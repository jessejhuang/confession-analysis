The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.\n\nWhile some 19th-century experiments suggested that the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;amp;message=Excludeme&amp;amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/confession/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","Why were your parents angry?

Prove it.\n\n&amp;gt;Those who purchase hormones on the internet instead of consulting a doctor maybe? cough cough\n\nMaybe learn to comprehend what you read? I said I looked up how to do it. I didn't say I did it. But, had I been denied by doctors (which I almost guarantee would have been the case at the time) and had I actually successfully bought hormones without a prescription, *I would have been right*. It would have been the right thing to do. I knew then what remains to be true: I am transgender and hormones were/have been an effective treatment for a serious problem. It would have been better to take the risk than allow the cruelty and short-sightedness of society stand in my way.\n\n&amp;gt;You may be right, it might be perfectly fine and we should allow children to make the decision to permanently sterilize themselves and alter their body chemistry whenever they want across the board.

When the fuck did I say \"whenever they want across the board?\" I never did. I support the WPATH Standards of Care. Read them. I have. That's why I know what I'm talking about and you don't. You don't actually know how much \"tact\" is used in the treatment of transgender people. You've never been treated for gender dysphoria. You haven't read the guidebook doctors use. You couldn't cite an example of a doctor who flouted the Standards of Care.\n\n&amp;gt;Think of Ritalin for example, remember all those massive over diagnosis' of ADHD in children and doctors prescribing adderoll to teens basing it on no more than a simple written test given in 10 minutes?\n\nADHD and Ritalin IS NOT gender dysphoria and hormones.

A lot of them are like your average people and don't fuss about silly stuff like someone using the 'wrong pronoun'. \n\nMost of the people who seem to have an actual mental illness are people who aren't transgender but somehow act as if they speak for them.\n\nFrom what I've learned from my psych class when I was in college is that it is a mental illness in a sense where someone feels uncomfortable with being what they were born. I've seen some in-depth documentaries. I'm not talking simple uncomfortable, like for example sometimes I feel like I'd feel more comfortable as a girl, but I don't mind being a boy. I've seen more extreme cases where people are so distraught and so uncomfortable with their gender that it drives them to self-destructive behavior, extreme depression and etc.\n\nA lot of these very extreme cases appear to occur in children at a young age and only get worse and worse as they grow older. These issues lessen or start disappearing outright when they are allowed to openly crossdress (for example at school and use the appropriate bathroom), or even in some very extreme cases get the surgery. A lot of people wouldn't think that trans wanting to use the appropriate bathroom wouldn't be a big deal, but it really is. It breaks the 4th wall in a sense.\n\nThat being said, I tend to address trans people by their preferred pronoun. I don't care whether they got the surgery or not cause more times than not I will see that they are pretty much the gender they want to be as a person, even if not physically.\n\nI draw the line at 'non-binary' though. If you ask me to call you a Ze or whatever the term is, I dunno man. I don't necessarily think there are genders beyond male\\female and maybe neutral. Though I feel like if you feel you are between the two you'd be okay with either pronoun.\n\nI'm not sure whether it's a common trend or not, I just think that as society becomes more open to it, more people feel comfortable enough to be who they want to be.","&amp;gt;Your point is pretty clouded, actually. Go back and read what you wrote. You started out with a couple of *this shouldn't be allowed at all* statements. A subsequent comment you seem to be arguing that doctors don't use any \"tact\" or caution when prescribing hormones, but it's not clear that this applies to teenagers.\n\nNegative. \n\nI am saying to **establish a precedent that it is perfectly okay across the board to allow 15 year olds to begin a transition that completely alters their biological makeup is not the way to go about it. It should be solved with more tact, therapy, and consideration of the future.** A lot of doctors are pressured or simply don't give a shit. Money talks bullshit walks, if your doctor won't do it for you you'll find another who will. \n\nI'm concerned about people jumping the gun and reaching conclusions that may not be based in anything more than emotional distress. You even say it yourself:\n\n&amp;gt;75-90% of children evaluated for dysphoria end up not having dysphoria by the time they enter adolescence.\n\nSo if you're saying that 75-90% of people who experience gender dysphoria at 15 end up **not** having it by the time they enter adolescence is it not crystal clear why merely green lighting transitions for any child who claims to have gender dysphoria is a massive problem? \n\n&amp;gt;\"It should be a **case by case basis**\". Well I have good news: It is! Doctors are cautious. These things take years of evaluation for teenagers. So, what are you on about?\n\nI'm \"on about\" those who abuse the system or are so misguided in their thinking that they convince themselves and their kids that they are transgender and immediately responding with hormones or surgeries when in reality they're going through a treatable mental health issue. It's fine to be trans, it's fine to be confused, but too many people jump the gun and that's my problem. Those who purchase hormones on the internet instead of consulting a doctor maybe? *cough cough*\n\nYou may be right, it might be perfectly fine and we should allow children to make the decision to permanently sterilize themselves and alter their body chemistry whenever they want across the board. But I remain entirely unconvinced and feel it should be treated with far more tact than it is. Think of Ritalin for example, remember all those massive over diagnosis' of ADHD in children and doctors prescribing adderoll to teens basing it on no more than a simple written test given in 10 minutes? (I know from experience) You have far too much faith in our healthcare system. \n\n\n&amp;gt;YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND GENDER DYSPHORIA! IT IS NOT THE SAME AS THOSE OTHER THINGS!\n\nBut I have a mental flipping illness, and if I could get rid of my BPD by chopping off my cock I still wouldn't flippin do it especially at 15 unless I found through a reasonable examination of my options and risks involved a positive benefit I can get from it. Unfortunately, there are MANY risks to transitioning. \n\n&amp;gt;No, it's not an ad hominem or an \"ad homonym.\" Ad hominem is an attack on the person arguing instead of the argument itself. Trying to discredit you, attacking your lack of qualifications, or questioning your motivation or prejudices is an ad hominem. An ad homonym is a slang misspelling of ad hominem meant to point out people who attack spelling/grammar errors rather than the argument. What I did was use you as an example in my argument and you didn't like it. I don't really give a shit if you didn't like it. The point is that denying someone medical treatment is cruel, and anyone who would inflict that cruelty on a 15 year old deserve cruelty.\n\nYou're literally insane.

Every little thing - every nuisance, every problem - is the end of the world to them. No juice in the sippy cup? Throw a tantrum. Hungry? Throw a tantrum.\n\nBut to toddlers - in their mind, at least - these are valid concerns, and how they react are valid reactions. To an adult, it's a bit dramatic. To *me*, it's dramatic. But to the toddler, it's not, and that's because their brain hasn't really developed to the point that these things are dramatic, yet.\n\nYou're in middle school, so you're... 12? 13? A **lot** of shit happens in your brain during that age, and some brains change faster than others. What you see as dramatic or abnormal may not be what your friend sees as dramatic or abnormal - but it by no means negates her cry for help. She's reaching out in the only language that she knows *now* - in a year or two, she might reach out differently, but she's still reaching out all the same. You reacting the way that you did? That's also because your brain is changing. To put it blunt, people at your age struggle with empathy - and that's because the part of your brain responsible for being able to feel empathy isn't fully developed, yet. I mean, how you reacted was obviously not a good way to react, but don't beat yourself up too much over it - you'll learn. You're not a bad person; you're young, and the fact that you feel bad for the way that you reacted pretty much implies that you're not a bad person. You just made a shitty mistake. We all did when we were your age. Lord knows I've done worse.\n\nLet her know that you're sorry. Tell her that you didn't know how to react, and understand that it may take a while for her to trust you, again - but that's okay. Demonstrate to her, in action, that you care about her. I don't know if the two of you are still talking, but if she doesn't want to talk to you, respect that - give her some distance. But I really think it's worth letting her know that you're sorry, and that you care. You just didn't know how to respond, is all. A cry for attention is still a cry for help; tell her that you didn't see it for what it was at first, and only saw what was on the surface and judged too soon, and far too harshly. It doesn't matter if she was crying for attention - she was crying for attention for a reason, and a pretty valid one at that. THAT'S what matters.\n\nOkay, so as for the cutting, itself? That's tough. I've known two people that used to cut - one when I was your age, and another just a few years ago, when I was ~21 years old. Please, please, *please* keep in mind that it's a really, really sensitive issue - it's not a matter of whether you're a good enough friend or not that determines whether she cuts or doesn't cut. There are no \"magic words\" to get her to stop. Trust me, you'll feel like there *must* be, but there aren't. What you need to do, more than anything, is to be patient with her - within reason, anyway. Cutting is obviously dangerous, and it is *clearly* a cause for concern, but short of physically restraining her or keeping her supervised 24/7, she's going to do what she feels like doing.\n\nMore than anything, try not to treat her differently - let her know that, yeah, you're concerned, but please keep in mind that you're her friend, first and foremost, and what she needs right now, more than anything, is the stability that friendship provides. I mean, yeah, let her know that you're here for her and that you're worried, and that you care, but if you focus too much on being a caregiver to her, that *will* change the very dynamic of your friendship with her, and most likely not in a good way - you won't be her friend, anymore; you'll be her therapist. There's a reason why therapists and psychologists exist, and why it's generally a better idea to see a psychologist or a therapist instead of relying entirely on a friend - they literally went to school to figure out what to say and how to help. It's so easy to say the wrong thing, or to accidentally make things worse. That's why she needs to see a therapist, if she can. They're generally trained *not* to say the wrong things.\n\nThere will be times where your friend doesn't want to talk, or where you'll have a really difficult time getting her out of her shell - but be patient. Don't force anything. Be her friend. And please, don't stop having fun with her - she needs the balance of talking about her problems to a therapist and having fun with her friends. If she teeters too much one way, she could end up dwelling too much on her issues, which is a recipe for disaster - but if the balance teeters the other way, she'll keep cutting; nothing will change, and none of her problems will be addressed. She NEEDS a balance.\n\nSorry for the long-winded reply. I just don't want you to make the mistakes that so many others make, because this is a pretty sensitive issue that's easy to accidentally make worse. Best of luck.","Ahh New Year's Eve baby!

It\u2019s important to remember that some people are good at their jobs, and some people are not. This is true of mental health workers as much as any other line of work. I hope this experience doesn\u2019t dissuade you from getting help. To get the most benefit out of therapy, you have to make a natural connection with the therapist, so you may have to talk to a couple. I had sessions that were ultimately not helpful with two therapists, before finding success with a third, years later. That said, no mental health worker can simply fix you. It\u2019s not like physical problems, like setting a broken arm or stitching up a wound. You have to put in a lot of effort to get better, but it will be worth it. That said, depression can never be cured, only mitigated. Once you work through the issues that got you where you are now, you will have to employ strategies like physical activity, socialization, self care, and possibly medication to maintain your mental health. Finally, I noticed a few suggestions that you go see that first psychologist and tell them how your experience was all their fault. I think that\u2019s a bad idea, it\u2019s spiteful and unhealthy. Better to start moving forward than feed the toxic feelings. ","&amp;gt; I never applied because I already knew that I couldn\u2019t get any. \n\nDrop this mentality now.

I myself went through a period of time when I was 17 or so where I started finding myself questioning my belief in God. Up until around this time we were always a pretty traditional Christian family. My mom was the most extreme of us all and spent all her life dealing with a lot of religious guilt and conviction, both self-inflicted and otherwise. My dad joined the scene a bit later, got saved at one of those big outdoor travelling conferences, and he jumped into the scene with a fervor.  \nI was lucky that my parents started to ease up and relax a little at the same time I started having my doubts, because it helped them be supportive of me. As I started to unwrap my feelings, I came to the realization that it wasn't God's existence I was doubting, but rather the church's, and people's, sincerity. From that revelation other truths started to become apparent to me: The posturing and pandering, the favoritism and popularity games...my problem wasn't with God. My problem was with people. Up until that point I had had the misfortune of being surrounded by some incredibly poor representations of the Christian faith, people hiding behind a facade of godliness while pushing their agendas, even at the expense of others' well being.  \nFrom the moment I removed myself from the public aspects of Christianity and made my faith a private one, I felt a peace come over me, and my relationship with God has only deepened since then. My parents came to the same point as well, and so now I can openly and freely talk with both of them about how we feel. For pretty much everyone else, I take on a \"none of your damn business\" attitude.  \nThis may or may not be the case for you. Each of us walks our own path, and we come to our own destinations. I've since met lots of people, both Christian and otherwise, who are wonderful people with strong morals and good ethics. If you feel like this might be the case for you as well, I would suggest removing yourself from the church establishment for a while. Seek some peace and quiet away from all the noise and hustle and bustle, and see what you can hear when the distractions are no longer drowning everything out.","I would totally date a man who did drag and fan girl over all his outfits.

Dreams are a way for your mind to organize and categorize your thoughts. Your dream most likely was not you truly wanting to be with him, it was merely a thought that was being filed away in your mind. I understand where you are coming from... But one thing you have to realize is a lot of the times we get wrapped up in the IDEA of someone. We fantasize, daydream and think about the situations that would arise and how they might be better than where we are now. That is human nature.\n\nLet's call it... The adult form of the imagination. Instead of daydreaming about dragons or space travel, we constantly think about where we would be if we weren't here. This can get dangerous if not put into check, but like I said before it is completely natural. My advice is to take a step back from those memories, thoughts and feelings for a few days and focus directly on where you are now with no tabs on your old friend. Love where you are and remember why you fell for your husband. Hell... If you get desperate and start thinking sexually, grab your husband or go somewhere and take care of yourself before acting anywhere else. Sometimes getting rid of that sexual tension on your own will do wonders for your clarity of thought. \n\nDefinitely keep us updated on how you do and reach out for help. There is no shame in any of this. You just have to take a step back and realize what your body and brain are going through.

I'm the guy you hate, I've been honked at more than I can count, I've been ridden off the road, yelled at, literally anything you've thought of doing or saying to a cyclist (other than killing them I guess) it's happened to me a number of times. \n\nFirst off, there's no greater desire as a cyclist to be away from cars. I hate being an annoyance, (unrealistic or not) it's dangerous and it kills the ride. I will find every opportunity to ride on a road with no cars, or a big shoulder but that's just unrealistic because roads = cars. Especially the ones that get you anywhere. It's the strangest thing though... Anytime a car honks at me and my friends, we've been on an isolated road for 10-20 minutes by ourselves, enjoying the scenery, the peace and quiet, sharing stories and laughing, we're as far over as we can get... then a car comes blazing by, honking swerving at us, and is gone in a matter of 3 seconds.. Back to 10-20 minutes of silence. It's the strangest phenomenon because you can't help but think \"why\".. It's so unavoidable... Literally so much stress, risk and rage for 3 seconds of inconvenience. (debatable if it's even inconvenient, most of the time it's a passable scenario) It's just a god damn drive. I know it adds up over time but by how much? I think this part here is where the cyclist entitlement comes from some people, when you see this so much its hard to not fight back a little. \n\nI promise about 95% of cyclists completely would agree with all the hate here, and also that they don't want to be sharing the road with cars either but cycling is a ton of fun and it's not worth giving up, even if it means being annoying to someone for 3 seconds of their life. Everyone should give cycling a try sometime. \n\nRiding on a sidewalk is such a lame solution, why would anyone even suggest that, you end up pissing off  everyone and all the driveways and side streets makes it so dangerous. \n\nRed light running is such complicated issue too, you got the thrill seeker types who are 0.05% of the population ruining it for all of us.. and then bikers who \"jaywalk\" safely when the lights don't pick you up. I'm not going to sit there for 10 minutes, no one will. \n\nSolution - Bike lanes.. Everytime. I've never got honked at for being in a bike lane, literally no one hates cyclists when they are not in your way. So it's not really the cyclist you hate, it's the roads. \n\nAnd lastly, maybe some understanding from both sides. I'm sure we could all grab a beer and have a good time together.

Sometimes I get stuck in the mirror thinking about dying, aging, and the pointlessness of everything, and it's really tough. Being stoned is definitely a nice break from this kind of stress, and I think it's okay to indulge in it as long as you're still feeling functional and healthy. \n\nHere's some stuff that helps me deal with my constant existential crisis, maybe it'll help you too:\n\n\n1) it's important to have a hobby you really like, that you can look forward to. Passion and creation can make life worth living simply because they're invigorating to experience, and can give you a sense of usefulness and meaning. Personally, I read, write, and play Dungeons and Dragons. \n\n2) Get into charity: Helping others less fortunate than yourself can really start to make you appreciate your privileges more, and relieving suffering in others can give you a purpose and help make your life meaningful. Even if we are just the products of evolution, we evolved to live in a society, to be capable o both suffering and compassion. Even if you think your actions don't have meaning in a cosmic sense, they will have a world of meaning for the person you're helping. If you don't like people, you can volunteer at an animal shelter. If you're super busy, try doing one unnecessary nice thing for someone else once a day, or even once a week. \n\n3) Experience art that deals with the existential questions you've been struggling with. Some of it may have answers for you, and even if it doesn't, it's always nice to know that you're not alone. Some of my top recommendations for media that deal with questions of purpose/meaning/existential crisis.\n\nBooks: anything by Kurt Vonnegut (but especially Breakfast of Champions and Sirens of Titan), Invisible Man- Ralph Ellison, The Catcher in the Rye- J.D. Salinger, The Bell Jar- Sylvia Plath, The Stranger-Camus, Don Quixote- Cervantes, The Unbearable Lightness of Being- Mila Kundera, Fight Club- Chuck Palahniuk, Infinite Jest- David Foster Wallace, and tbh Harry Potter books 5-7. \n\nMovies/Plays: Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Waiting for Godot, Hamlet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (but see/read Hamlet first), No Exit, Fight Club, Synecdoche New York, Groundhog Day, Birdman, Mr. Nobody\n\nStraight Up, Dry Philosophers you could check out: Satre, Kierkegaard, Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, and, of course, Nietszche himself \n\nAlso, horror and anime/animation tend to deal with Existentialism a lot, but not everybody likes those genres (I'm a big fan), but if you like those I can give you some more recommendations if you want.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the huge post. I think about this stuff a lot too. I think what's most important for you to keep in mind that the struggle for meaning and the knowledge of our own eventual Death is part of the human experience, that most people will struggle with whether they want to or not.

Obviously the child was weak because they couldn\u2019t handle being consistently bullied by someone else. This is a child, not an adult. They do not act rationally. Expecting a child to behave as a negotiator/politician is ridiculous and naive. To think that bullies would have responded to be told \u201cyou are hurting my feelings\u201d is equally naive and stupid. Parents and teachers were involved and there was still no change in behavior. A catalyst must occur to reach that change. If the child is never bullied again from their one response, was it not successful and worth it? If the bully never bullies again, was it worth it?That sounds like perfect conflict resolution. \n\n2.

When you had the \u201cperfect relationship\u201d at 18 your friends were probably jealous of you - wondering when they can find the love of their life, if they ever can. \n\nAlso, I strongly believe that things happen for a reason and that it takes many factors (time, geographical location, persons involved) for something to happen (I.e. you meeting your wife at that point in time at that place, introduced by that friend). Given this, if you had partied and lived life like your friends did in your early 20s, you may never marry this woman that you love so dear or the circumstances of your marriage may be different (perhaps even less happy?) \n\nLife is full of regrets, and I\u2019d assume even the most successful or happy person had wished for a little difference in their life that they could not achieve due to some limitations (e.g. past their youth or limited resources). But such is life; that we are limited by choices and cards dealt to us and that we can never have the whole cake and eat it. \n\nI\u2019d say cut yourself some slack on the remorse and embrace whatever you are contented with - also make changes if possible to those that you aren\u2019t too contented about! :) \n\nTL;DR: such is life - everyone has regrets.

The vast majority of gun deaths are suicides, or domestic assaults, accidental shootings, etc.  The cause of most of this nation's gun problems are a result of *so many people just have an unsecured gun in their home*.\n\nIf you think about it, if people did not have guns in their homes, they would not have *the opportunity* to use a gun in any of these bad ways.  Australia recognized this, and outlawed certain types of guns, and conducted massive buy-backs, which had the effect *of removing guns from people's homes*. And Australia saw a corresponding decline in gun deaths as a result.\n\nThe same would be true in America - it's a fact that less guns would equal less gun deaths.  It is what it is regardless of which 'side' of this debate you're on.  So, this is the guiding principle I keep in mind any time people bring up this gun debate - is what is being 'saved' or 'taken away' something that would be pretty beneficial to actually saving lives?\n\nThe other thing I like to think about is that - as you know - guns are a hobby for many people, whether hunting or just shooting.  People enjoy it, and I believe people should be allowed to do it.  But another principle I have is thinking about what constitutes safe and necessary equipment for people to enjoy that hobby.  Are silencers, huge magazines, bump stocks, etc - really necessary for people to conduct this as a hobby?  I don't think so, but people can disagree on that - but it seems reasonable that we could put limits on what people should be able to have as equipment, because like in Vegas, a guy with a bump stock could be using his rifle like an automatic rifle - and there's a reason we outlawed selling automatic rifles after the 80's.\n\nAnother guiding principle is thinking about whether people just carrying guns around increases overall public safety.  Mass shootings are extremely rare, as are other circumstances where people owning handguns and carrying them around would be effective.  This has to be considered against the 'cost' of having millions of handguns just sitting around people's homes, which, as I said, leads to a situation in which a lot of people use those guns to commit suicides and domestic violence, for instance.\n\nI'm not trying to give you an answer here - but I would just encourage you to think about this for yourself, and in a common sense way.  Don't let people on either side of the issue - read about both sides yourself, if you're interested in it, and understand the facts, because there's no crystal clear solution to this - it's an argument about what true rights people have in this society vs. the cost to this society from fully expressing those rights.\n\n","The problem here is there's a different culture. That's why there's comments that say it won't work here. Additionally even if it wasn't a cultural problem, it'd have to be a federal movement to prevent people from just skipping over state lines and getting a gun, and right now gun laws are mainly a states right issue\n\nIt could work in time, but the chances of the culture changing and the federal government taking the issue away from the states are low enough for most people to just say it won't work.","She lives with them","[deleted]","No it does not make you a worse mother.

I have seen, heard of, and worked with people with BPD who have held career jobs. I'm going to be honest here though, I've also helped people with BPD get on disability benefits because I did not believe they had the capacity to hold employment. Those individuals were in their late 40's and 50's however, so I think age and history had a big part of those decisions. Getting you to work will be a big hurdle, but it'll also be something I think you can accomplish. A huge component of BPD is the depressive and anxiety symptoms, existential anxiety paired with a depressive numbness is going to make work really challenging for your brain to think of in a positive-light. Unfortunately, our society isn't the best at providing support to people in your position. I can't give much advice through this sort of message, but don't be afraid of volunteering your time, joining Peace Corp., or finding work with less pay but more meaning making, even if only for a short time. \n\nAs far as finding a therapist that cares... that can be really hard. Plenty of therapist care, but they also view their work as employment and BPD may at times need more than an hour per week. Others care, but they aren't experienced or knowledgeable enough about BPD to adapt to your specific needs in treatment. The person has to tolerate your intensity when it occurs and be comfortable with your missed appointments on the days where you can't make it. My advice is call perspective therapist before your first appointment. Let them know about your diagnosis and ask how they go about treatment. Talk them about the number of voice-mails they are capable listening to per week, whether or not you can have flexible schedules and how they address anger, anxiety, panic, etc. in their work. I know many of the people I've treated have felt as though they were constantly being judged, declined, rejected, abandoned...  even by their therapist. I would say during that first conversation you need to ask the person how comfortable they are sharing their experience with you in the moment. I've been accused of not caring plenty of times, but for me in particular, they often felt as though I was overwhelmed (I tend to pull for people to try to take care of me). Usually though, they weren't accurate and I was comfortable talking about what was going on for me behind the scenes so to speak. If the person is CBT/DBT/ACT or the other behavioral treatment styles, they might be a bit more rigid in their treatment with you... which is helpful in a way. If the person is more client-centered you may feel they aren't being helpful even if you are connected well during sessions. If the person leans towards the more psychodynamic approaches (asks about your childhood history, parents, early memories, etc) they may be helpful, but it'll be slow and is not well supported as a treatment for BPD. So... what do you look for as a treatment style? I would advise someone who understands these styles, but is flexible in their approach and willing to integrate when needed. \n\nPlease don't give up. There is a therapist out there who can help. It's important that you know what will work for you and what hasn't, I would be really up-front with those before you even sit down for a session. Make a ranked list of which therapist seem strong in which areas, then try them out. The right therapeutic relationship is going to do wonders to help you stay on your feet.

For every person I helped to get sober, there were many I wasn't able to help, or at least that how it seemed. What I learned was:\n\n1. You never know how you may help people, and much of the time you'll never see the fruits of your labor. All you can do is plant seeds and hope they grow. I've had patients come back months and even years later, doing better and living clean and sober, to tell me that it was our talks that got them thinking and led to their decisions to change their lives. But most of the time, they came in to see me, I tried to work with them, and then they were on their way. I hope I helped more people, but I'll never know. \n\n2. I couldn't allow myself to get too emotionally invested, or question myself too much. I did constantly review my methods and tried to improve on what worked, and when things went way south, try to understand what I did wrong and correct it. But, at the end of the day, all I really could do was believe that I did the best I could, try to do better the next day, and know that I was making a difference to somebody, no matter how small a difference that might be.\n\n3. You can't save everyone, and quite frankly, that's really not your job, anyway. Your job is to help people save themselves, because they are the only ones who can. Now, granted, I didn't work with kids, and that's a whole other area, but I still think the idea is valid here. I did what I could and saved some people in the process, and for them, my efforts were worthwhile.\n\nMy advice, for what it's worth, is to learn from this so you can do better with the next one that needs your help, and don't let the setbacks get you down. If you take this work too personally, you'll burn yourself out and then you're no good to anyone, including yourself. Practice some self-care, get your mind right again, and get back into the fray.

Assault is assault, non-assault is non-assault. When there's consent, there's consent. When there isn't, there isn't. Once you involve someone, consent is required.

Christ, so many people have been abused all over the world (myself included) and they are in a relationship or married to someone who can emotionally support them through it.  I give my husband as much emotional support as he gives me (which is a lot) and we are both happier, healthier and more secure in our lives as a result.  \n\nHowever, unlike OP's husband, mine is able to emotionally connect with with at least part of what I've been through in my life.  I also have a complex genetic disability which he has been absolutely phenomenal about.  It would be easy for him to call me, or think of me as, lazy for not being able to get out of bed some mornings.  Instead, he thinks about what things are like from my perspective, and works around it, helping me where he can and letting me have time and space to deal with the things he can't change.\n\nYes, sex deprivation is a real issue in some long-term relationships and marriage, but OP clearly told him that, after coming out of psychiatric treatment, she needed some time to come to terms with her current flashbacks.  He couldn't give her a month, instead he sexually assaulted her three days in.\n\nOP, if you ever read this, you're doing the right thing.  Your husband is not emotionally mature enough or capable of supporting you through what you're experiencing.  This is not your fault, and I'm sure he has his reasoning, but he went against your wishes and had sex with you anyway, knowing what you were dealing with.  Surely that is classed as marital rape.  Just because you're his wife does not mean you are his property.\n\nIf you are absolutely convinced in yourself that you need to give things 'another try', then I can't tell you not to.  But I can offer some advice; start from the beginning.  Go on dates.  Hang out.  Talk.  Go for long walks on the beach.  Anything to try and get him to open up enough for you to drive home how your shared past has tainted what love existed between you both.  If he wants to give things another shot, he has to apologise (and actually truly mean it when it's given) for abusing you in the way he did.  It's not okay for a man to have sex with his wife against her will.  It's just not.","I haven't.  I'm not into humans.","[removed]","There's nothing inherently bad about horse meat. The taboo actually originated from Anglo-Saxon customs that treated horses as highly valuable, useful, and \"noble\" animals. Not unlike how Hindus started treating cows as \"sacred\" due to the fact that cows gave labor and milk and were therefore highly valued creatures, just with horses it is less directly to do with religion.\n\nIn Europe, the taboo against eating horse is not nearly as strong as it is in English speaking countries, and it's even less taboo in many non-European societies. Not that it's that common to eat horses anywhere, it's not exactly something that was ever common as livestock (due to historic economic reasons, and the fact they were moire useful as beasts of burden) and the lack of strong tradition of horse eating and also the much higher (current economic) needs of raising horses means it's not that common anywhere else either.\n\nIt's just far less (or not at all) taboo. Horse steak is apparently delicious and also quite lean, \"juicy\", and rich, but historically it was something mostly done with older horses. Eating horses was never seen as morally \"wrong\", or just inhuman or disgusting, in most parts of the world. It was also something that was very un-pragmatic.\n\nThe only places in the world that have laws against eating horses are in English speaking countries. In the US, it is illegal to kill a horse for consumption. These sorts of laws do not exist outside of the anglo sphere. It is very much so an anglo custom to view horse eating with disdain.","They're teenagers. This isn't child abuse.

Honestly, take a deep breath and think about it. Nothing really matters, whether you die tomorrow by your own will or 70 years from now time will eventually erase you. When people succeed in certain facets of life it makes them feel great at first but then a lot of the time people end up feeling useless again, as if they aren't capable of doing anything else or that it wasn't good enough. The human condition is confusing because everyone is sad a lot of the time even while they post their happy selfies. You are NOT alone in this. Even though nothing matters, everything matters. The way the wind can make leaves dance, the way a disgusting stagnant pond or a deer carcass can sustain life. Tiny things or realizations about meaning something or feeling successful are so easily blinded. The fact that you did not succeed in killing yourself is a success you should feel proud about. I don't know if anything I can ramble about (sorry if it doesn't make sense or annoying) will help in any way but if I could give you one bit of advice it is this. Take a deep breath, it will eventually be okay. And yeah, cliche, but as time marches forward things in our past become meaningless and trivial. Suicidal thoughts are not trivial but in your old age you will feel like you succeeded only because you are there and not here. I love you stranger and I hope nothing but the best and most bright days ahead of you. We all feel alone, we all feel incapable, we all are with you.

Sex is probably the second most important part of a healthy marriage, with the first being personal compatibility. If she doesn't want sex and you do tell her that you WILL get it somewhere else if she continues to refuse you. If she gets angry about it, leave. It sounds like she refuses to compromise on this, and so should you. If she doesn't want to have sex with you, great.

And honestly my lack is destroying me, although its nice to see that it exists. Without compromise our world will go extinct. And honestly I'm at a crux in my life where things have to change for me for the better or it'll get worse. So maybe it's for the best for us not to be friends because I don't want nor can handle any more hatred or rejection, and I have learned that fast attractors can easily turn into fast detractors and if you end up shitting on me I know I'll just make this world pay for it, worse than what I feel it'll likely already receive from me.

I'm sick and tired of people doing the same thing over and over again because \"he should feel guilty\", even though he already does and it fixed *nothing*.

(Just adding a little levity, hopefully.)\n\n&amp;gt; If my brother poisons my sister and destroys her kidneys...\n \nHe is the attacker in this story - with ya so far. He is guilty of poisoning her. AND, her kidney failure (for the sake of your argument) _is_ the direct result of his actions. Guilty. \n\nTo connect the dots clearly \u2013 if we go with her version of events \u2013 OP pregnant as a direct result of his actions. It's completely his fault. He did it. Even if he didn\u2019t intend for her to get pregnant (!), her pregnancy is a direct result of his actions \u2013 as long as we simplify and ignore alcohol/method of coercion, etc.)\n\nJust like your sister didn't have a choice in the poisoning, this woman didn't have a choice in the pregnancy. Perfect so far.\n\n&amp;gt; and I'm the only suitable donor\n \n? You'll need to line this up for me. Are you saying abortion is the only option? Are you also saying - like your poisoned sister - that she will literally die without the abortion? That's clearly not the case. If so, the analogy breaks down early.\n\nLife might be - at least in the short term - difficult. But, her life is _not_ over if she doesn't abort the child. Her marriage isn't necessarily over and her family isn't necessarily destroyed. I'm _not_ saying the odds are good, and I\u2019m not saying it would be easy, but she simply does not die if she doesn't kill the kid. It\u2019s simply untrue. There _are_ other potential outcomes in this case and other potential choices.\n\n&amp;gt; but if I do donate one, we must both be on dialysis for life at our individual expense...  \n\nThis just isn't a biological nor financial reality. You're changin' the rules/outcomes on me, Sandi. I personally _know_ people who have donated/received, and none of them are on dialysis and/or are suffering, and insurance covered most of the cost.\n\n&amp;gt; Should I be forced to donate the kidney because she will die if I don't? \n\nYou've narrowed this kidney thing down with _so_ many stipulations - which again, don't mirror the current situation at all nor reflect reality. There _are_ other potential kidney matches - even if they're rare. People _do_ live on dialysis, even if they don't get a match immediately. It's simply not the case that there is only one option available to OP and only one set of outcomes if she doesn't take that choice.\n\n &amp;gt; Both are innocent. \n\nThere are three people in the story, and in the analogy. Both who? The kidney-failure-poisoned sister and the donating person who is the only one on the entire earth who can save her because dialysis won't work for her?\n\n&amp;gt; One must suffer if the other is to survive.  \n\nAgain - we gotta agree to lotsa stipulations in your kidney story which are just not medical realities. Woman I dated donated to her brother. Both are peachy. There are other possibilities besides \u201csuffering.\u201d\n\n&amp;gt; Should the one who will suffer be forced to do so? \n\nSeveral points: The only person we know for sure who will suffer in your analogy is the sister, and we only know that that suffering will be physical. She could certainly choose to end her life instead of going for dialysis and putting herself on the waiting list for a donor. She\u2019s not forced to suffer, depending on your view of suicide. \n\nWith regard to non-physical suffering: There are LOTS of stories of LOTS of people who choose to face adversity and overcome it and/or endure it with gratitude and poise. We call those people \u201cinspirational.\u201d They\u2019re all over ESPN, reddit, local news, facebook, etc.  The outcomes aren\u2019t as limited as you present them to be.\n\nYou put constraints on your story to indicate that there is only one possible outcome, and therefore only one possible choice, and then even declare that choice a non-choice \u2013 someone else is forcing her to take that action. None of this reflects reality in OP\u2019s story, and certainly doesn\u2019t reflect medical reality in the kidney story.\n\nAdditionally, the donor in this story has agency. Since she\u2019s not the baby, nor the rapist, she must be the pregnant woman.\n\nAgain, this doesn\u2019t line up. She has choice. She doesn\u2019t have to donate. Her life doesn\u2019t change if she donates \u2013 she\u2019ll have to be careful about not overdoing the protein and keeping herself hydrated so as not to tax her kidneys if she donates, but otherwise, not a biggie. If she doesn\u2019t donate, her life doesn\u2019t change at all. Perhaps sis and other family members will judge her, but as we\u2019ve also established \u2013 this is an extreme example \u2013 it\u2019s simply not the case that there is only a 1 in 7 billion match for kidneys, and while not comfortable, life can and does go on for people with kidney failure.\n\nOne of the important points here is -  the sister (you) has choice, and she doesn\u2019t necessarily suffer if she doesn\u2019t \u201cdonate.\u201d \n\n&amp;gt; Should it be illegal to choose not to donate body parts when you will suffer physically, financially, and emotionally?\n\nYeah - you really lost me here. Are you saying ... I dunno what you\u2019re saying. Don't know where the illegality of refusing to donate comes in. There are no illegalities in the original story at all (saving the alleged rape). At this point, anything she chooses is legal \u2013 keeping, aborting, adopting out.\n\nMy guess is you\u2019re talking about legalities of abortion, which simply doesn\u2019t figure into OP\u2019s situation, and we\u2019ve both agreed that it\u2019s a legal option. Legal/not-legal doesn\u2019t figure in.\n\nIf, not, and I broaden your argument to attempt to connect a loose-dot here, no one is forcing the woman to keep the baby, adopt it out, or abort it, and (unless we look at a couple of bizarre recent cases), no one can prevent her from doing any of the above, either. \n\nThis is one of the points you wish to deny  - that it\u2019s her choice.\n\n&amp;gt; Should we strap the kidney refuser down and incarcerate them? Is the person refusing to give up the kidney a murderer? Or is the person who poisoned them the murderer? Both?\n\nOK \u2013 again, this makes little sense. Again, no one's forcing anyone to do anything on threat of death. I would hope you\u2019re not equating having a child you may not want with death. She still has choice.\n\n&amp;gt; This woman must suffer physically, financially, and emotionally because other people think she's obligated to sacrifice everything she loves, her body, and possibly end up suicidal because the baby she didn't choose is more important?\n\nOutcomes aren\u2019t perfectly predictable, especially to the extent you\u2019ve predetermined. There\u2019s also a bit too much hyperbole here. There is no \u201cmust\u201d in this panoply of outcomes, and especially not as a cause of her having this one child. \n\nSuicidal, too? OK. Then are you now saying it\u2019s OK to kill someone to relieve depression/prevent suicidal ideation?\n\nNone of the choices \u2013 adoption, abortion, keeping \u2013 will change whether or not she suffers emotionally. And no outcome you\u2019ve mentioned will change what you\u2019ve stipulated \u2013 that it _is_ a child.\n\nSuffering physically? Women have been carrying children and giving birth for millennia. We have humanity, so I\u2019m concluding the suffering isn\u2019t unbearable. But, are you stating it\u2019s OK kill someone if a person causes you 9 months of \u201csuffering?\u201d Are you really advocating killing another human being for the convenience of another? I would have a hard time believing that you would have considered carrying children unbearable suffering to the point of killing them \u2013 at the point, or later. If you did (logically) think it OK to do so, I\u2019d concede that you were being logically consistent.\n\nYou stipulated it is a child \u2013 a person. You simply don\u2019t get to kill another because it\u2019s an inconvenience. People are always some level of inconvenient.\n\n&amp;gt; How do you decide who's more important and when someone is obligated to accept suffering for someone else?\n\nYou don\u2019t. IMO, the value of someone\u2019s life is absolute, not relative. If given a ballot, I would not choose to check the \u201ckill Sandi\u201d box over the \u201ckill Bill Gates\u201d box just because Bill provides 120,000 jobs here, 14.7 million associated jobs, billions to the economy, and millions to charities. Your right to exist isn\u2019t a comparison game, no matter how little utilitarian value you contribute, nor how inconvenient you may be to others \u2013 even Bill Gates.\n\nSo, I _don\u2019t_ decide who\u2019s more important. It\u2019s a rubric I don\u2019t use. (See Peter Singer of Princeton if you want to investigate a utilitarian paradigm of human value.)\n\n&amp;gt; Both people here are innocent. She has a right to defend herself.\n\nThere are three people in this story, since you claimed the pregnancy is actually a child.\n\nYou are correct. She absolutely had a right to do whatever she needed to do to get out of the situation with her brother, whether it was coerced, or actually forced. Kick him, knife him, whatever him.\n\nHowever, the baby has no agency and to claim that a natural biological process is an attack is simply not true. The baby has no volition, and we don\u2019t get to say it does \u2013 that it\u2019s attacking her - just because we don\u2019t want the child. To claim that the baby is operating differently than any other baby \u2013 that it\u2019s attacking the mother - is a fabulous and convenient falsehood. The only difference in this baby is the desire of the person to have the baby, which is based on the baby\u2019s means of conception, only.\n\nAgain, I believe you have (a) kid(s). Did you consider them to be attacking you while gestating? I doubt it. Why? \n\nThe validity of an argument follows from the validity of the premises. You\u2019ve agreed it\u2019s a person, and we don\u2019t get to choose to kill someone just because their presence may be inconvenient, or even difficult.\n","I'm sorry that you had to go through that. For what it's worth, I don't think you've failed. In fact, it seems that you have loved and cared for your son through an impossible situation.\n\nI just wanted to say, that you can still parent your son while he is institutionalized. You can visit, take part in his care, provide enrichments to his life (toys, electronics, books, activities that you know he likes), and advocate for him should any issues arise. Even if he is not living with you, you are still a good mom and can continue to be.\n\nI know a mother of an institutionalized boy, and there is no question that she is a devoted mother. She visits often, is always getting updates from the staff about how things are going, and talks about him all the time. After an adjustment period, she seemed really at peace with her decision and seems to be making the most out of it.","I know how you feel and I sympathise.\n\nIt's never too late to make a change, build the life that you deserve!\n\nI used to regret dropping out of school too early and not reaching my full potential, now I'm studying for my degree!\n\nFind a passion and grab it with both hands!

You tell yourself you're in control, but if you didn't have this arrangement he would still cheat on you. You've resorted to this because you're so desperate to make it work with him, and to not feel so betrayed and heartbroken every time he cheats. I actually have two good friends in kind of similar situations. One of my good friends had a hysterectomy years ago and sometimes it still hurts when she has sex, not all the time, but her dick husband (not just a dick because of this but also because he is verbally/emotionally abusive and manipulative) is not understanding at all and uses this whenever he decided to cheat on her as his defense. Apparently he claims she doesn't give him enough sex, and it's wrong for her to ever refuse him, so he is FORCED to cheat, and it's not his fault. So, now they came to the \"arrangement\" that they will have a sort of open relationship. Like you, it makes her feel like she is in control of the situation because she agreed to it. Sad. My other friends fiance had a huge pill problem, like he was just high on pills all the time and it's all he really cared about. Now, she \"allows\" him to have a certain number of pills a month, but that's all he can have. She resorted to this because he refused to ever stop doing pills, even if it meant she would leave him. Pills were more important to him than she was. I just don't understand. If your husband starts cheating more often than what you agreed on, are you going to eventually increase the number of times he is allowed to cheat so you can \"make it work\"? Where is the line of what you're willing to put up with?","lol","Again, her initiating for once does not come across as trying to overcome anything.

But you're missing the golden key in the advice of working out. Selecting your own goals, destiny, lifestyle is actually a major path of recovery for victims of rape. Working out is a form of smithing that pathway by selecting a stable format to practice what you want, for yourself.\n\nRape strips people of the absolute concept of the paradigm of forging the world with one's own identity. It becomes shaky, and doubted at nearly all times. The choice of working out, fighting for what you want against the pain it comes with, is a good practice to rebuilding yourself after trauma. However it lacks the absolute return to the former total identity that allows recovery. So it's more just a matter of stabilizing, not necessarily healthy continuation.","Incompatibility in bed is a very real problem that could be a deal breaker.

It's very closely tied with your natural born tendencies and while some do change, most simply just can't. If it's getting to a point where the dissatisfactory sex life is all you can focus on when it comes to your relationship, I'd say thats a pretty good sign to start considering the next step; whether that'd be ending and moving onto another partner or seeing if she in fact falls into the smaller group of people who had the sex drive inhibited in them the whole time that was never touched upon to be able to unleash them so to speak.","Time and time again, institutions have protected the abusers from consequences by attacking the credibility of the accuser. I would suggest watching 'The Keepers' and using a similar strategy of using a third party to reach out to those who were under the same teacher until there are at least two with the same story. Then, with at least two independent testimonies from people who have not collaborated (because a third party lawyer was used as an intermediary), the authorities will be less likely to blame the victim and continue sweeping under a rug.    Alternatively, you could send a letter and just hope that yours isn't the first one they've received.

I'd recommend digging deeper into the sources of your skepticism, and researching what people from both sides have to say. In my journey I found what converts from atheism to Christianity had to say about some issues enlightening. However, a lot of the reason I believe is because of personal experiences in my life and the lives of those around me that would be impossible to ignore, and those aren't things that could be proven elsewhere; I know many Christians who believe due to that sort of thing too. Just the fact you still feel called into belief and can feel God's love even through his community is saying something, so I'd suggest continuing with your questioning and keep seeking out truth for yourself.

We actually all go out from time to time and occasionally Jamie and I will exchange a pleasant snap message or two. Jamie and I aren't nearly as close as we've ever been. We don't talk in depth.

I felt like I couldn't be creative - no ideas were coming to mind and nothing I executed came out the way I would have liked. Not only did that hurt, but I also had a pretty challenging professor and I took everything she said to heart. I ended up dropping the courses for graphic design (drawing blueprints) and design 1, but I stayed in my architectural freehand class because I genuinely enjoy drawing and was actually the top of the class. So, I found out that I am not meant to be an architect and it shattered my heart into millions of peaces, but I picked them up one by one by doing something that I felt that I was good at and I improved it.

I want to help people out in life, so please don't take my comment in bad faith. However we need to get some things straight, you're not a \"man.\" Sorry, but in the world we live in it is highly unlikely you've faced any or most of the most challenging moments of your life. Plus, just from a purely biological perspective, you still have years of puberty left for you. Yes you are capable of reproducing, but that doesn't mean you're done with all the biological components of maturing into a full adult. \n\nLet me give you some advice for life. Stay away from extremes. At your age it's extremely common for people to swing between extremes. Some people have personalities where it's less overt, other people have it more overt.\n\nUntil you're at least like 23, I wouldn't be surprised to see a politically passionate teenager make extreme identity changes. At your age, I've seen far-right supporters turning into hardcore feminists or socialists. I also have seen it the other way around too.\n\nAs impossible as it is for you to imagine, I wouldn't be surprised if in five years you become someone who loves quoting Karl Marx and hates the right wing with a passion. Your personality *will* change, not just from experiences but from biology too.\n\nSo how do you tell what experiences you have at this age should be ones that you should consider definitive or temporary? Basically, if it's \"chill\" and \"normal\" then it's probably something a bit more meaningful to you in the long term and not just a phase.\n\n\nI get that you're likely chaffing for a way to distinguish yourself, but you will have the rest of your life to do absolutely nothing but distinguishing yourself. Please, try to be patient, for now just apply a stoic spirit towards your lack of freedom. Be \"normal\", be \"chill\", stay away from anything \"extreme\", and focus on enjoying shit that's actually in your hands. Like, sports, skills, hobbies, friends. Focusing on something you have no control over is maddening, and that involves hoping the course of history and politics goes the way you want.\n\nOh last bit of advice that isn't even about your age, that I think really *everyone* should try to do. Get off of electronics unless you actually need to be on it. Limit how much you use it on a daily basis. Don't use it just because you are bored. You will become a way happier person, and you'll probably end up learning much more actually useful things (like reading books that teach you certain skills or hobbies). All my friends who have been in the military said the best part of basic was the lack of electronics and how much freer they felt without their attention and mood being affected by electronics.","[removed]","Some of you people are way too compassionate to a fault.

Oppression in the western world, privilege, etc. Maybe that's because I have yet to experience these things or I really can't understand them. So I don't know if this is the kind of person you wanted input from, but quite honestly I see nothing wrong with it. I find the person that accused you of being \"more than a little racist\" is unreasonable and blowing things out of proportion. Being sexually attracted to a race or feature does not make it a fetish, or racist. You never specified you viewed them as exotic, or sexual objects so to make that assumption is a bit wild. Being hyper aware of them puts me on the fence, but you also clarified it's not because you view them with a discriminatory mind. You are also conscious of this. That consideration alone makes it seem like you aren't racist considering racism is learned. Nobody is born racist. \n\nFrom what you've said in this post, I don't see anything wrong with it. Keep doing you, bud.","just because it's the norm for you doesn't make it just or right.

OP **used to make** several million dollars for the company last year. OP is petty and insecure not to mention reffering to herself in the third person.","&amp;gt; I also learned many things about how seducing women generally works and I started seeing the patterns around me in other guys. I learned to see that if you worship the ground they stand on and put them on a pedestal, women generally won't be attracted to you - you have to learn to \"bust their balls\" so to speak. Tease them. This is counter intuitive to a lot of guys, but just being nice to women and doing whatever they want, won't make them attracted to you. But there's a lot more to it.\n&amp;gt; \n\nI know that. I actually think this applies to both men and women and it counterintuitive to both but since women get more dating experience they will realize it sooner. I once had a woman try to come onto me by just being really nice and it failed (and then I thought about suicide as I always do after women flirt with me since I always feel I turned down my last opportunity.)\n\nThe problem I have is knowing when to go from being nice when introducing myself and basic things like that to doing whatever the male equivalent of a shit test is and how to actually do that. I wish I could have a female platonic friend to practice it with but I doubt that is a possibility.\n\n&amp;gt;Anyway, so I learned how to talk to people better, and I understood seduction better in theory but I was still too chickenshit to put it into practice and talk to real girls and risk rejection. Also I had a weird, huge internalized inferiority complex and I thought people and especially attractive women could never like me in that way, partially because I was intensively bullied at school throughout all my life. I had huge anxiety just when talking to women, and I couldn't think around them.\n\nFeels.\n\n&amp;gt;But eventually through the internet in a community that I was in about depression and suicide, I met a girl. It was easier to talk to her because it was online and I was not facing her directly. She was a nice person, our personalities worked together. She was also a very attractive latina photo model, 10/10 in looks, the type of woman from my dreams basically. I told her my life story and applied many things that I learned through the pick-up literature. I learned what worked for her, basically how to \"work\" her emotions in a way that made her more attracted to me and respond positively in general. I basically consciously did the things that would normally happen \"naturally\". It's a lot easier to think about what I'm doing when I am talking to an attractive girl through a keyboard, instead of in person. Eventually we fell in love and we met. I completely expected her to hate and dump me the moment that we met but it didn't happen. For the first while that we were together, I was completely out of my mind high that I finally found somebody who loved me and had affection for me. Imagine all that desperation and then finally having it satisfied.\n\nI don't think it is realistic to join suicide forums to meet women. And I actually imagine I would be worse online than in person.\n\n&amp;gt;Anyway, I worked through a lot of my strong psychological issues. For a long time I just gave her oral sex and did things with my fingers. And I enjoyed the intimacy in general, but she desperately wanted to have the full experience with me and she took it personally that it was so difficult for me to have sex with her. It hurt her and she thought it was because of her. I really wanted to make her happy so I worked hard to overcome my psychological issues. Eventually I started to be able to have sex and it got easier and easier. After a while it became normal. I think sex is kind of overrated compared to all the hype. It's still fun though. But not worth a lot of hardship. I know that in your current situation this is hard to grasp, but there are far better things in life than sex.\n\nI only want sex for the validation. I already imagine sex as being painful and unenjoyable.\n\n&amp;gt;And no, I don't think I ever completely got over it. But my \"involuntary celibacy\" was based on psychological problems that I had... and still have, but to a much lesser extent. They still pop up a lot and it is still difficult for me to talk to people. I stutter a lot sometimes etc. But it's a lot better than it used to be.\n\nI don't see any way it can be otherwise. \n\n&amp;gt;I think I got really lucky that I found somebody to love me and who wanted to stay with me despite my faults, and who helped me through all that emotional baggage. I don't think most women would put up with that, and justifiably so. Without her I'd probably be a desperate as fuck 30 year old virgin now, or I'd just be dead.\n\nI don't know whether more or less women would be willing to deal with a history of sexual abuse. Do you think it depends on what they think the payout will be in the form of later relationship quality?","You are trash","[removed]","How can somebody who understands consent and sex not give consent?","Thanks for aggressively agreeing with me and downvoting me.

CKCS have extremely high rates of chari malformation/syringomyelia which is an extremely painful disease, as well as mitral valve defects/heart issues. Crossbreeds are usually bred without health tests on the parents (OFA, pennhips, CHIC, etc.) and there is no standard for a mixed breed-for example one puppy could look like one breed and another could end up like the other breed. They aren't guaranteed to be healthier than purebred dogs either, especially if both breeds are prone to the same problem or neither of the parents have been tested for hereditary diseases before breeding them. Another example is labradoodles or goldendoodles- labradors, goldens, and poodles are  all prone to hip dysplasia. most labradoodle breeders are breeding for $ because there is no breed to better, and there is no purpose to their breeding really in most cases. (the exception being australian labradoodles and service dog programs) There is no garentee that the puppies will have a poodle coat, and most doodles are nightmares in the grooming department, and half of them still shed.\n\nTL;DR:crossbreeds aren't nessicarially healthier, your best chance is a breeder doing genetic tests for breed specific issues on both parents, and not getting a dog breed where almost every individual in that breed is afflicted by the same disease early in life(cavalier spaniels and syringomyelia, norwegian ludenhunds and Lundehund Syndrome, pugs, bulldogs, frenchies, and pekes and brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome and hip dysplasia.

And I don't buy it. Sure, being fat/large/unhealthy is stigmatized for women. But being tall? I rarely see female fashion models who are short. Pretty tall women are adored, pretty short women are adored. Height has nothing to do with it. A fat woman will look fat regardless if the guy next to her is tall or short.\n\nOne could be forgiven for thinking that your comment was just a way of masking guilt about the issue. Height is an arbitrary characteristic that people have no control over, unlike their bodyfat and physical fitness. Is it wrong to screen on height? I can't judge. But I do think it is worthwhile to question why tallness is considered attractive.\n\nIronically, in my experience I've known shorter men (5'6\" and under) to be more manly than tall guys. They take control better and are generally emotionally stronger, possibly due to being picked on more and having hat to be in more fights. The tall guys I've known are generally nice and easy going, but get passive aggressive and bitchy when they don't get their way (possibly because they are used to things being handed to them). It is really awesome seeing a tall guy who does take to power easy, but I've never seen it other than in the movies. Just my experience though, you're mileage may vary.","Half.

If you are feeling aroused in the waking life when you think about other people being in the same position as the character, then you may have developed a kink. If you can't orgasm without thinking of this, then you have a fetish. Fetishes rise from childhood normally, so if it is a fetish, it's something that has been tucked away for a very long time. I found out that I had a fetish after I lost my virginity because I noticed that the feeling that I had while my partner and I were having sex was similar to what I felt when I thought about the object of the fetish. I never had an orgasm until I learned that. Hopefully, that isn't the problem and it's just a kink because if it's a kink, you can do without it. If it's a fetish, it's one of the more extreme and unhealthy ones, so you may want to visit a therapist to help you to overcome it.","You don't get money from sex but sex is much harder to obtain than money.

You may feel very strongly towards one and just a tiny bit towards the other.\n\n&amp;gt;I think people believe I'm gay because I didn't have a dad.\n\nNo, people think  you're gay because of the following:\n\n&amp;gt;Even my MTBI type (yeah yeah I know, I'm one of those people) is INFP which to most is a very \"feminine\" personality type.\n\nFemininity in men is often associated with homosexuality.

I'm really not sure.","[deleted]","Um....no","Sorry for taking so long to respond, do you honestly think this is my fault? I actually want to know.","Yes, it means you're a racist piece of shit. Just own that you are being a racist piece of shit, because that is what you are being. I mean, if you merely have an aesthetic preference for white skin that doesn't have a serious genuine effect on who you are willing to reproduce with or marry, it's racist, but it's not shitty racism. It's a genuine acknowledgement of a ridiculous preference that doesn't actually matter that much, because you won't let it. But if the line between you deciding whether or not to MARRY someone is personal ethnic preference: you are a piece of shit. I kind of hope you lose your ability to reproduce, because if racism is even 0.01% genetically determined, I would really rather not take the risk of the genes of such a grotesque person being propagated.

","I don't think OP should have lied about being a virgin, and I think that they should come clean. *However*, the exact number of sexual partners is OP's business.\n\nMy counter argument is that there is a stigma with having more sexual partners = slut. This could result in polled women saying that their numbers are lower than they actually are, which gives us the range of 6-8. And then people use these results to say that 11 is too high, when the average is most likely much higher than 6-8. Which just adds to the stigma.\n\nIt's a vicious cycle.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with having an opinion, but when OP's problem is about a lie, and people are slut shaming her, that is wrong.","deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2464  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/51425)","So you are bothered my me saying that it's not right yet you are also bothered by people not thinking it's a big deal?

(I know calling it a contract is a bit cold, but it gets my meaning across).\n\n&amp;gt; To you sex is a bare physical act\n\nIt's not though. Sexual intimacy in a relationship is extremely important to me. But what goes on in a booking room is an entirely different thing; it's *work*, and what intimacy exists there is an illusion the client is paying to experience. And I suppose that's where we differ. Sex and love in a relationship aren't detached for me, but the sex that happens in a booking room, being utterly divorced from love or intimacy, is. \n\n&amp;gt; you're saying \"accept it for what it is\" as though your definition of \"what it is\" is more valid than mine.\n\nThe thing is, unless you've been a sex worker or in a relationship with a sex worker, my definition of the place sex work occupies in the life of one *is* more valid. Am I saying it's right for everybody? No. But the mainstream who feel threatened at the idea are predominantly coming from a place of ignorance about what sex work actually is and bringing a mountain of social prejudice with them.\n\nI know I'm making a lot of jerky, abrasive comments in this thread.

It sounds like you're pretty successful, but that wouldn't prevent such a thing, merely change its nature.\n\nA) Don't worry so much about making your mark.  You sound very competitive and driven, but remember that you need to live life along the way, not just celebrate victories at the end.  Take some time for yourself to do that.  Whatever that means to you: play around with art, music, travel, or whatever.  Find something other than your job and just take some time to play with it.  If it's not fun, try something else.  We're adults now, but play is still important.  It rounds us out and makes us fuller people.  We're not just our jobs.\n\nB) If you want to make a significant impact, there are a lot of people out there who just need someone to listen to them and encourage them.  There will of course be some that don't pan out, but there will also be success stories that make you feel like you've actually helped and made a difference in the world.  It seems a very minor thing, but I feel like my life has been worthwhile no matter what happens, because I've done my best to help others who were in a low place, and some of them are much better off now.  I didn't solve their problems, but I was there for them when they needed someone, and now they're good.  So that's something.\n\nGenerally, open up and spread yourself out a bit.  And take some time for yourself and what you enjoy or want.  It'll make you a better person if you're more rounded out.  Goals are good, but they're not everything.  There's a lot more to life than achieving goals.\n","My parents tried and failed to stay together for the kids until my dad left when I was 14.

After going through all of the transformations that a pregnancy puts a body and mind through, adoption becomes even more fraught and can even be psychologically damaging, so I would never look at that as an easy option.\n\nWhen someone makes a choice to be involved with someone else sexually, one of the things they're choosing is to accept that the other person may change their mind about things, like whether or not to continue being intimate (so, \"no\" mid-coitus = everything stops and no one guilts or forces anyone else to do more than they're willing to do) or whether or not to keep an unintentional pregnancy.\n\nAll of that is part of why sex and the multitude of implications and complications it introduces are so fraught and should be taught way, way, way more carefully than it is now, right?\n\nSo, this guy should have accepted that he made some wildly selfish choices and now there's a human with his DNA out there questing for his roots and owned up to that.

After that he did have them but he hasn't wanted to use them. \n\n&amp;gt;Not to mention, he said you don't get hard because \"you know your place in the relationship\"? You mean the relationship he's not willing to acknowledge or make public with you?

He's displayed anger in such a way over if you've told or not it makes me wonder if A. He's fiercely closeted, or B. He's married or has a GF who doesn't know he's also into men. And that seemed to scare you despite you telling him the truth for 2. And lastly, he's not really caring for your well being by going bareback.\n\nI know for sure he's not married and isn't dating a girl. I have been to his house almost every day for the last couple of years. I never really thought about why he didn't date. But he says he isn't as gay as I am, but that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. But I don't want to try to tell him what his own sexuality is. \n\n&amp;gt; After all, you don't live with him. Do you truly know that you're the only one he's seeing? I'm not trying to fill you with doubt, I'm just pointing out the things you've told us. You're 18. He sounds like he's your first love. Of course you're going to want these things with him. But unfortunately, it also makes you blind to the bigger picture, the things he's practically screaming to you through his actions.\n\nI'm pretty sure. I don't even have to call before I go over, I just go whenever I want to. And he's always home unless he's with me. \n\n&amp;gt; You're young, you feel nice, you're someone he can keep on the side.

Read the story of Sodom and Gomorrah and see that it was OK for Lot to offer his daughters up for sex to men to whom they certainly weren't married.  Read the NT and see that while we're supposed to remain chaste if that's how we were when called to Christ, it's not shown as the only path.\n\nAlso check Galatians 5:19-21 and the surrounding verses.  There we are warned against, yes, sexual immorality (and an undefined \"impurity\") but also all this stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,  idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,  envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. \n\nThat's a *lot* of stuff, and almost none of it has anything to do with sex.  But somehow that's what certain modern sects concentrate on.  (While mostly ignoring divorce, which Jesus spoke strongly against, unless it's something they can use to force women to remain in abusive marriages.)

Read about church history and how the \"sexual sin\" of premarital sex wasn't even on its radar for hundreds of years or more.  It's funny how many of these pastors decry the Catholic church and say they're not really Christian because you shouldn't have to go through a priest to experience God, and then they teach you to never question your pastor.

People who have a license to legally carry a gun around, almost NEVER use it.  Also, many violent crimes have been prevented by an innocent bystander who was carrying a licensed gun.  \n\nI'm not sure what country you are from, or what they are teaching you about America, but our gun situation is also majorly over-exaggerated.  Yes we have a lot of guns and criminals use guns here for bad things.  Criminals also use guns for bad things in other countries that outlaw guns (ie: UK, etc.).  It doesn't mean U.S. is any less safe.  It's arguable that our police force is more affective **because** they have guns.  If only criminals had guns, and police had batons, criminals would have control of the nation.  Having such a large border to the north and south means guns will always make their way into the U.S. and criminal hands, as it's logistically impossible to prevent.  \n\nIn summary, innocent bystanders who are legally licensed to carry a gun are more likely to help you in a dangerous situation than if they have no gun.  Visit New York City and then visit anywhere in Texas.  Texas is stereotypically viewed as a lawless gun state where everyone carries a weapon, and New York City is very anti-gun.  Trust me though, you will like Texas 10x more than New York City, and certainly feel safer.  There are, on average, arguably more nice people in Texas as well.  \n\nHere, these could help you out a bit:\n\nhttp://www.gunfacts.info/gun-control-myths/concealed-carry/\n\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2012/12/gun-rhetoric-vs-gun-facts/","You're breaking my heart.

She had a legitimate reason to need the drugs but again, due to a lack of education about them, and her brain not being capable and developed enough to making informed adult decisions she ultimately fell victim to addiction.\n\nKids brains are underdeveloped and sometimes the odds are just against you. That first time kids think, \"no big deal,\" and start doing drugs recreationally and before you know it they have a brain disorder, a disease, called **addiction** and while they may want to stop they simply cannot without intervention and it is a deadly disease too.

I'm no medical professional but the vomiting and ringing in your ears COULD possibly be a concussion or some other internal injury. If possible consult with a medical professional to double check. I don't think this is the most LIKELY case, but airing on the side of caution, if you have access to affordable healthcare a quick checkup couldn't hurt.\n\nThat said much MORE likely the ringing sound you hear is very common. I forget the name of it, but its essentially a sensory overload that your mind fills with a ringing sound because it doesn't know what else to put there.

Its nothing to be concerned about and 9/10 i don't notice it.\n\nthe time you heard something coming from your charger is also quite possibly real as well. Exceptionally high frequencies can be heard by people, but MOST start losing the ability to hear higher frequency waves as they grow older. This can begin as early as your 20's with some almost never remembering the ablity to hear high frequency waves. You seemingly have the ablity to hear that particular range, and those around you haven't. Again completely normal and with time you too may or may not lose that degree of hearing, it impacts people's lives to a minimal degree.

","I have no idea if the person you are talking with is real or not but I'll share my story with you (check my history I've shared this several times).  I'll just copy and paste.\n\nDidn't happen to me but to a friend of mine. Found out at a pool party that his wife of 20 years had back in college had slept (more than once) with someone else. Now you would think that wouldn't be that big of a deal but they were high school sweethearts and I know for a fact he was faithful to her all throughout that time. The reason I know he was faithful is because I saw him turn down 2 opportunities flat out.\nSo at the party the person she had been with ended up being there as well (have no idea how he got invited to this particular group of people btw). Well she apparently neglected to mention to her \"friend\" that she never told her at the time boyfriend and now husband so he just mentions it casually in conversation. Needless to say one of our other friends heard this and bee lined right to him and asked him if he knew.\nGod I wish he would have kept his mouth shut and not run over to him because what ensued was honestly one of the worst things I've ever been witness to. First of all the husband immediately confronts both of them while they are standing there. The wife just immediately gets red faced and is embarrassed. But what made it worse was the guy acted like it should be no big deal and well that just made it worse.\nNeedless to say to avoid the idiotic fight that was going to happen the person who owned the house asked the guy to leave to which he said he had done nothing wrong and didn't want to leave. Which then led to 3 other guys picking him up and throwing him to the curb (literally).\nIt only gets worse from there. My friend who is normally very mild mannered and I've only ever heard him get mad with someone else twice before that just lost it. He was making quite the spectacle of himself so I basically drug him to a large out building away from everyone else and mostly his wife who was in tears at this point. BTW this happened a few years ago but at the time everybody was either very late 30's early 40's so as childish as this all sounds it wasn't teenage drama shit although that is exactly what it was just with adults.\nLong story short he pissed away a 20 year marriage over this. I did everything in my power to try and convince him that he was being stupid and that they had a great marriage and had two wonderful kids and that he was throwing away his family for something he didn't even know happened over 20 years ago. All to no avail.\nHe divorced her and nobody was better for it. Years later she looks like she has aged 20 years and lives in a small 1 bedroom apartment. I have no idea if she has ever dated again or not but I know from her family that she has been devastated by all of this and has had several hospitalizations for depression.\nBoth of their kids started getting in trouble at school and with the law. I think they both have finally grown out of that phase but I know one of them spent some real jail time for stealing a car.\nAs to him? He is now not the guy I knew. He is a sad a bitter man who has absolutely no faith in anyone and virtually no joy in his life. For years after the event he would only refer to her as the \"whore\" until I told him that I just didn't even want him to talk about her anymore.\nDo I know what he should have done? No, but I know it should not have been what he did do because as I said none of them are better off.\nNow before we leave with him being the total villain here I do want to give a couple of other perspectives on this. She was the only person he had ever been with and well until she went up the road to college he was that for her as well. Does that mean anything? Maybe not to me or you but to him it meant everything. I know he felt betrayed, he kept telling me over and over how his entire life had been a lie and a waste. He suffered severe panic attacks after that and he had one suicide attempt that I was told about. I didn't know it happened until he was in the hospital and I went to visit him and he made me promise that we would never talk about it and I've held up my part of that.\nHonestly the whole thing just sucks. I guess I mostly blame him even though I am his friend, but in the end I guess if I look at it through his eyes the one person in the world he trusted above anyone had lied to him and had continue to lie to him for a couple of decades.","Better late than never... .that being said. \n\nYour asshole must have been hellapoopy.","the last time I went on a weight loss regiment, I started logging calories - just understanding how much I ate was helpful.","Women is my taste ","Apples to oranges.

Only people who have truly been mean to themselves can reflect this meanness onto others. Meanness, I would say, is rooted in a kind of misanthropomorphism, which in turn comes from a fundamental self-loathing. Gazing upon your own ugliness and badness, naked and vulnerable, allows you to pick it out in others. \n\nThis kind of meanness is true, bona-fide and effective. It is not merely petty malice or a flash of anger. It is slow and considered, analytical rather than impulsive and emotional. It is heavy and bottomless and has no shape or form, but has a dense, unknowable core that can chafe and weigh so heavily on the heart of its victim that it creates the closest thing to a fresh wound that mere words can. It invades and colonizes the victim's mind and soul like a blind parasite, contorting and writhing and ultimately becoming a part of them until it eventually grows into something so terrible that the heart can no longer recognize itself. \n\nWhat happens after that is up to the individual. That, my friend, is the beauty of true meanness. \n","I doubt you have remorse","Heinous crimes are the ones on Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU.\n\n","Just lemonade.

Please excuse any typos or grammar mistakes I'm on mobile with a fussy toddler beside me.\n\nWhen my husband and I first got together I went through his history. I know, invasion of privacy. Well that led me finding out he was responding to all sorts of Craigslist ads anywhere from woman, men and trans women. It sorta gave me the skivies. We had only been together about 2 months so it felt like cheating but I was 21 young and hungry for love so I ignored it. Flash forward a year later, we are literally sitting in a McDonald's drive through where I make him admit that he's at least bi-curious. \" Okay\" I think, at least he admitted it. Go forward another week. He's convinced me to peg him. I'm uncomfortable with it but I do it, bc I love him and I want him to be satisfied. Fast forward another year! Yay! I'm pregnant and due any day. I'm not sure if you've had a child but for me my libido went DOWN. I mean I absolutely had no sex drive and that's approved within the last year. But at the time all I got was pressured to have sex, and he would sulk and wine until finally he stopped. 6 months later I go through his phone again and holy moly there was so much porn and so much craigslist ads, responses starting when I was only 3 weeks postpartum. I was so hurt. I wanted to leave but I didn't. I had a 6 month old, I had no income, I had horrible credit so I had just no hope. And now we are here. I discovered he had a masturbating problem not to long ago, he started begging me to peg him and have a threesome. And now he's slapping me around in bed bc HE wants to try being dominant. But I don't want to speak up bc other than our differences in bed we are so good for each other. I see a lot of me in you. The only difference is that you got the courage to walk away. I think you made the best decision and obviously the best one for  YOU! \n\nQuick edit: He never met with anyone off Craigslist that I know of, I believe him \nwhen he told me that. This will probably sound unheard off but he used the responses to come up with fantasies to masturbate too.

Pretty normal and healthy thing to do- but not everyone is into it. If you start doing it and someone is like \"woah buddy I don't like that\"- you stop and everything is cool.

But if you dwell on that attraction, start finding reasons to be with that person, and start spending mental and emotional energy on it, then you start to take away from your own relationship.\n\nInstead, you acknowledge that yes, that person is attractive, but then instead pour your efforts into romancing your own partner. When you start fantasizing about the other person, gently turn your thoughts to what you're grateful for about your own relationship.\n\nYou'll probably always be attracted to that other person, but that attraction doesn't have to become an all consuming passion.

You're really in favor of wholesale infanticide if a child is inconvenient?\n\n&amp;gt;And yeah that would be life, but that would be a single celled organism capable of living on its own in environment, not a single celled zygote that has the CAPABILITY of becoming a multicelled organism, but that cant survive on its own in environment.\n\nThis is a roundabout way to get there, but it seems you're pushing for the viability definition of when life begins? There are a number of problems that come with that definition. \n\nFirst of all, it contradicts the scientific definition of life.\n\nSecondly, I'd say that a large proportion of zygotes do very well in their given environment (i.e. a womb). Removing a living thing from its natural environment naturally results in a failure to thrive. That hypothetical martian amoeba might do poorly on earth, and I would likely not survive being dropped off at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThirdly, life is a biological concept, not a technological one. By defining life/nonlife by viability, it makes it determinant on the technological capacity of humans to perform external gestation rather than on the biological realities of the fetus. The viability date has moved about a week per decade since Roe v. Wade. Has the actual concept of what life is changed in that time as well? By the same token, would we say that those who are kept alive by modern means (e.g. those people reliant on dialysis) are no longer actually living because they are no longer viable?\n\nFourth, that technological definition creates an inequality between those who have access to up-to-date medical care and those who do not. Viability is the potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth, natural or induced, when supported by up-to-date medicine. Those fetuses whose mothers don't have access to up-to-date medicine are then arguably not viable (i.e. their right to life is withheld) much longer than those who have better access. Does the life of someone who is born into a remote tribe actually begin at a different time in gestation than a Los Angeles suburbanite?\n\nFinally, what are the acceptable losses? We agree that the line between life and nonlife is binary. But if we draw that line at viability, we are left with the problem that the viability of individual fetuses varies from person to person, yet we set the allowable cutoff number of weeks as a universal rule. Therefore there will be some viable fetuses who are terminated unjustly. At what point does that become immoral?\n\n&amp;gt;you better not ever kill a bug or eat meat, what says that a life in our species is more important than a life in another species.\n\nI do. I am an unabashed speciesist. Humans have different inherent rights than other species. If you have a parasite inside of you, you have the right to go to a doctor and have it removed. But you do not get to claim that that parasitic organism is not alive. That would clearly be a false claim. The right to destroy that parasite comes from the fact that you, as a human, are entitled to more rights than a tapeworm. Conversely, if an organism in your body is human, you do not have the right to kill that fellow member of the species for any reason outside of self-defense.","Hm, that's funny, because it sure is one for the US Census.\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045216/00","That's funny, the US Government sure considers it one.\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045216/00","[removed]","Calm your tits, it's just a movie and dinner.

Whatever food you're eating while taking Adderall is enough to satisfy your hunger because of that reduction in appetite, but that does not mean whatever you eat is enough to support your body in a healthy manner. Needless to say, this is not a sustainable model for losing weight or staying at a \"healthy\" weight. \n\nSecond, at the end of the day it is still an Amphetamine and should not be taken lightly. Less dangerous than meth ofc, but it is still addictive and carries a high risk of dependence. Considering your history with drug addiction it is indeed worrying to be used in a recreational manner so it's good you recognize that.\n\nIf you get the urge just remind yourself of the consequences and whatever benefits you perceive from loss of weight do not outweigh the potential harm you're putting yourself in. \n\nAlso, don't sweat the day-to-day weight differences. Body weight changes a lot from one day to another and it's quite unreliable to compare individual consecutive days regardless. A more productive measure would be weekly averages and that may also take the stress out of comparing minute details on the per pound level. \n\nGood luck and all the best ","As straight as a circle.","Getting drunk enough among people you don't trust is never a good idea, getting away with the crime shouldn't be your first concern, not being a victim of it should be.

If she's off doing heroin is that none of my business? If she's about to jump off a bridge is that none of my business?\n\nI feel bad for your situation, OP, but I would suggest there's a different way you could think about the situation outside this immediate rejection of your daughter. If you were to talk to the parents of long-term drug addicts, for instance, who tried tirelessly to look out for and help their kids in the early stages of addiction, I think what you'd find is these people have realized what it truly means for a person to be responsible for themselves - to see someone's life unfold in an a truly awful way and not be able to do anything about it, at all - and how to think about dealing with it differently.\n\nI have a family member with addiction, and the one thing I've learned is that you can't make anyone do anything they don't want to do.  You can try to incent them in ways - as in your attempting to incent your daughter to change her lifestyle by threatening to evict her - but that doesn't really work - in my case, drugs ultimately become the most important thing to this person's life and everything else is unimportant, even this type of harsh incentive.\n\nTo your point, yes, as a parent, it should concern you that your daughter is behaving in ways you fear are risky or dangerous (in a sense), and maybe you're also upset and sad because your now-adult daughter is behaving in ways that you feel are immoral, ways that 'you didn't raise her to be'.  You could certainly judge her, as you have, and take this eviction action as you see fit - that's within your right as basically her landlord. However, it's unclear to me that will accomplish anything more than just driving her further away from you, and possibly further into these activities you feel are unfit.\n\nYour daughter is now an adult, and she is sending the message she wants to act in adult ways, be treated like an adult. If what her sexuality desires is many partners and experiences, you're not going to be able to stop that. How do you think the families of porn stars feel about their children?  Certainly just as you do now; but what can they really do? Nothing.  But is your daughter now really that much of a different person than she was a couple years ago? Is she really now a 'terrible person' because she's done adult things you consider immoral? If she came out of the closet and told you she was a lesbian, would you reject her because of her sexuality?\n\nWhat I've learned as someone dealing with an addict is that the only person I can really help and control is myself.  I can't make someone else stop taking drugs, stop doing whatever it is they want.  But what I can do is step back, be less judgmental, think about the situation from a long term perspective, and do what I can to both preserve my own sanity relative to the situation, and maybe do things that plan to help the addict in the long run - things that do not escalate the situation or break ties with the addict.\n\nNow your daughter is now an adult, while it may concern you, it's really no longer your business how many people she's sleeping with, how much she's partying, etc.  Adults make their own choices, and while hers may be bad choices, there's really nothing you can do to stop what you consider immoral behavior, because she's no longer yours to control. But you also aren't required to associate or support behavior you consider immoral.\n\nThe real problem here is that your daughter is being disrespectful to you as a parent and landlord - the person who's (I'm guessing) subsidizing and supporting her.  I agree that if you set the expectation for her free/subsidized living conditions - that she be home at certain times and no overnight guests - then breaking that could merit eviction.  \n\nHowever, it seems like you're combining that sort of cut and dry rule set with making moral judgments about her behavior, trying to incent her to change by taking away her living conditions, and that's just not going to work.  She's an adult now, so you should treat her like one.  She should respect your living arrangements or move out, and you should learn to step back, be less judgmental, acting more like a landlord than parent, and do things to preserve your long-term relationship with her because things may eventually be very different between the two of you down the line depending on how you handle this now.\n\n\n\n\n\n","[deleted]","Stop before this comes back to bite you in the ass.","Not trying to talk you out of it - you do you - but can I ask what reason you have to rush?

I am most definitely NOT referring to \"toxic masculinity\" as defined by feminists here though, that's a completely different thing.  I think that the way we view masculinity in many western cultures is unnatural.  Boys learn what is expected of them, and girls learn and internalize this view of masculinity as well.  Then we have boys growing into men trying to project an unnatural and unhealthy image to other men and to women who require this of men as well because this is what they've been told a \"real\" man is like.\n\nI think that if we had a hard reset on our culture and allowed men to start over we wouldn't see anything like our current expectations of masculinity.  In other words, it's a complete fabrication.  Indeed if you look at other cultures in the world you see men behaving very differently.  These expectations require men to betray their true selves, to hide themselves away from the world, often times revealing themselves to no one at all.  It is a lonely, and in some ways desperate life.\n\nTo get back to the OP: Your husband has been living a lie, as all good little boys are taught to.  You bought into that lie as well.  Now you two have been together long enough that he wants to finally allow the one person he trusts the most to see him, to truly see him as perhaps no one has ever before.  You can choose to reject him and continue living the lie, or you can try to unlearn what you have learned about men and masculinity.  You can allow your husband to teach you what men really are.","http://www.xnxx.com/video-6a5ydb1/racist_girl_s_surprise#_tabDownload","SRSDiscussion has hit the topic a few times.

You admit it's adversely effecting your life- you're drinking too much and engaging in risky behavior. If you can afford to drink out so often, you can definitely afford to see a therapist.\n\nNow, from a total layman's perspective, as someone who has dealt with having taboo kinks, do your absolute best to get over the guilt of having these feelings. It's the guilt that makes you feel worthless or undeserving of happiness- not the kink itself. \nI remember feeling appalled or freaked out by some of my new found interests. I even went down a similar self destructive path. The truth is, we can't help what turns us on very much. \n\nHuman sexuality is complex and fluid.

But you're smart enough to know you'd never jeopardize your relationship with her by doing something crazy. So what's the deal? Maybe you're confused about these new feelings. Maybe they're in conflict with what you believe to be moral. Maybe you're exhausted by the invasive thoughts. Those are all fine things to examine- especially with the help of a professional. \n\nHowever, your internal conflict is no reason to punish yourself. If you were able to stand in judgement (literally) of someone that just made your same confession, would you sentence them to the pain you're feeling? Would your adoptive mother want you to feel so much anguish? \n\nThe mere fact that you're concerned about these thoughts and that you're being hard on yourself hints towards you being a good person. Don't let this guilt and shame derail you from being that good person you want to be! Talk to a professional, unpack these feelings, gain some deeper insights into who you are, consolidate that info with your life, and move forward. Obvious easier said than done, but you owe it to yourself, and even your adoptive mom, to find peace and happiness!","Hi Throwaway1234566669, welcome to /r/confession!

To me it doesn't seem like this has anything to do with gym girl when you look below the surface.  To address the main points: relationships change over time.  Sounds like you have moved past the honeymoon stage with your current girlfriend and you have got to the point where you may have either realized you two aren't as compatible as you thought, or are for whatever reason not able to successfully communicate leading to this breakdown of intimacy.  Have you asked her why she's not as excited about sex any more? Have you told her how it makes you feel?  Is she on antidepressants or something of the like that may be reducing her libido? A relationship of text messages is not a great way to ensure communication of wants, needs and feelings.  \n\nSecond, you may be growing in different directions and as I previously suggested, you and your current gf might not be as compatible now as you were before.  This just happens sometimes.  You are young and at the point in your life where you are going to be shaping ideas, lifestyle choices, deciding who you are and where you want to go, etc.  People do more growing mentally and emotionally between 18 - 25 or so than I think many of us are aware of.  I am 32 and can say that the person I was at 19 was not the same as who I was at 25 and that person was not the same as me at 30.  This is true for lots and lots of people.  You two may be growing away from each other and if you don't put in the work to communicate and mutually decide that you want to stay in the relationship, then it's time to go.  It may hurt in the short term but listen, this is not always a bad thing.   You have to take it as a learning experience and apply what you've learned to the next relationship.  If you do want to be together for the long haul, every LTR eventually gets to a rough patch.  Only you know how you feel about the other person, and whether or not you are sure about being with them is worth working through those rough patches.\n\nLastly before I close this book of text: you can not possibly be in a fulfilling relationship when the threat of the other person's suicide is what is keeping you in it.  I don't know you or her so I am not judging here, but this \"if you leave me I will kill myself!\" manipulation is exactly that - manipulation by the other person to trap you into staying with them.  This is not healthy for either of you and will only serve to build resentment until one way or another it all blows up.  She may not be intentionally doing this, but this just means the communication is all the more important.  To me it sounds like you're already pretty much done with your current gf and are only in it to avoid the guilt you're afraid you might feel if she harms herself after you go.  But you can not control what she does, you can only control what you do.  You are an adult that makes their own decisions, as is she.  Decide for yourself what YOU want in the short and long term, then clearly communicate that to her.  If she seems like she's going to hurt herself at anytime for whatever reason, make sure she knows you are going to call the cops and her parents to get her the help she needs.  \n\nAnyway.  Good luck.","I think this is better than getting HIV or being murdered... just saying.

Maybe a few historical examples will help.\n\nEveryone used to think that the heart controlled emotions, not the brain. I mean look at the heart! Right in the center of your body. When you have intense emotions, your heart beats faster. When you experience joy or sadness or heartbreak you literally feel it in your heart (or seem to). There is a very clear correlation, and the obvious explanation is that the heart is causing the emotions. It would be pretty far out to suggest that the brain, which is a lob of goo that never seems to do anything or feel anything but a headache, controls literally all of your complex thoughts and feelings.\n\nEveryone used to think that stress caused ulcers. People getting ulcers were more stressed out than other people, and you can feel the stress in your stomach (or seem to) and it feels bad. Clearly the logical explanation is that this bad feeling is \"eating away\" at your stomach and eventually causes an ulcer. By the way it took a guy literally drinking bacteria to prove that they weren't caused by stress, that's how far out the idea was.\n\nEveryone used to think - and unfortunately some still do think - that vaccines cause autism. I mean you give a kid a shot with this giant needle, they cry and start to run a temperature for a day or two, and then you start to notice them acting differently. It isn't long before the seemingly normal child looks totally disabled and can't function. The obvious explanation is that it was the foreign material you injected into them! To suggest that autism has a wide range of genetic and environmental causes that aren't clearly understood but definitely don't stem from vaccines, the timing of childhood vaccines and childhood autism is totally coincidental, is pretty far fetched. \n\nBut, in all 3 of these examples, the very clear and obvious and \"probable\" explanation (and the one that was simple and validated people's world view) was completely wrong. In fact, the entire history of science, from the idea that the earth revolves around the sun all the way to the nuclear bomb, is predicated on the idea that the simple common sense explanation is usually wrong. \n\nAs they say, \"The most exciting phrase in science is not \u2018Eureka!\u2019 but \u2018That\u2019s funny \u2026\u2019\"\n\nBecause things are always more complicated than you'd think, and simple ideas about causation almost never turn out to be correct. \n\nEDIT: And also, I just want to say, I get it. I understand how alluring the simplicity is. \"It is clear! Obvious!\" It validates your world view. It makes sense. How could it be wrong? \n\nIn fact, the Heritage Foundation and others love to take advantage of this simplicity. The good people are good because they're like you and they'll be rewarded. The bad people are less virtuous and they'll be punished. The problem is it is much more complex, and the reason they're selling on the simplicity is because you're easier to control that way. A simple, clear world view with exact ideas about who is good and who is bad. That is an easy one to control. \n","God I hate those goat fuckers too, hope they all get killed execution style.","Ahhh yeah... doesn't sound cool at all.

What are you going to do to lower these or take them away?\n\nSince you know the cause, in the future you can do the following things.\n\n- Warn the kids up front if you are tired or stressed. Then they can decide to leave you alone, or risk you blowing up at them.\n\n- Clean the house. A clean house is a more clear head. It allows you space to take in a little more stress before reaching the limit.\n\n- If you have a partner, and you feel you are about to blow up, ask your partner to step in and walk away yourself.\n\n- Change the things in your life that cause you stress. With professional help if necessary. Don't be a hillbilly, keep an open mind and seek out a therapist that you can connect with.\n\n- Apologize to your kid, explain that what you did was wrong, and why it was wrong. Explain how it came to pass. The stress, not what he did.\nExplain that you are the adult and thus responsible for the situation etc.\n!Do not lay any of the blame on him!\nAnd tell him (and the other kid(s)) which changes you'll make to prevent this from happening in the future.\n\nKids are the most forgiving creatures in the world.

While religious text are frequently used as a justification for militant groups, typically the politics which frame the actions of such groups are rooted in concerns and values which have little to do with the religion itself.  ISIS' relationship to Hezbollah is a good example of this.  Both groups are Islamic, yet they are currently at war with one another largely because ISIS seeks dominion over the entire Islamic world.  Despite coming from two different sects of Islam, both groups are comprised of radicalized individuals who engage in terrorist activities primarily because those are the most effective means of armed resistance available to them.\n\n&amp;gt;Would you agree, that viewpoints concerning the combination of church and state, anti-gay-laws or the subordination of women are incompatible with western societies?\n\nNo.  The West has its own religious movements which are desperately trying to tear down the separation of church and state, roll back gay rights, and subordinate women.  (Hell, when it comes to that last one, most of reddit is on the anti-Feminism train).  The supposed incompatibility between the West and extremist Islam has more to do with the outsider status of Muslims rather than any broad difference in goals found between the principle opponent of Islam (the Far Right) and extremist Islamists.","Something something fucking sjw's\n\nr/tumblrinaction","Why was he even in uniform?

I'm sorry. ","Your comment is awfully insensitive. My boyfriend knows that I sometimes miss my ex and he knows to what extent I do, too. I didn't \"string him along in this\", he took the decision himself to be in a relationship with me and support me through this, knowing fully well what happened and what my thoughts on it are. Both of us had quite hard lives that involved a lot of emotional pain and he is a survivor of rape and sexual abuse, too. It's not a matter of deserving better or worse. By being in a relationship, we both chose to accept the other's past and to support each other even in moments of mental breakdowns and irrationality.","You monster","Then who would \"huge on my own\" be?","Go camping.\n\nOr to a museum.\n\nOr a tourist attraction\n\nBoys usually like war related stuff\n","Forgive me if I am a little short, but I have not yet had coffee this morning.  For the most part it sounds like you do get it. As I understand it, one's sex refers to what private bits they have and one's gender refers to the socialization and gender roles we are taught our while lives. So yes, saying gender refers to the stereotypes assigned to each sex is pretty close. \n\nEdit: just saw sarahbeast's reply and it is much better than mine. ","I understand what you're saying. As long as you treat both children the same and show them equal amount of love an affection I don't think there is anything wrong with this. Your reasoning makes a lot of sense and you aren't saying you DON'T love your second child at all, just that you feel a different, deeper love for your first. \n\nYou are absolutely correct about parents saving face. Every parent I know has a favorite child. I think it's natural. Of course you would get along best with and enjoy your time most with the child you relate to most. I don't think there's any shame in that.  You mentioned that your second child is a lot like your ex husband while your first is a lot like you. I can definitely understand why you would enjoy your first kid's company the most. Parents are humans and humans are social creatures with complex personalities. Just because you produced a human doesn't mean they're a clone and you're going to feel deeply bonded and in love with them. \n\nA lot of parents regret having their children. You are not alone. \n\nI think it's wonderful that you understand this about yourself, OP. I think it is part of what makes you a good parent. I would much rather parents admit this to themselves and be aware of it so they can make a conscious effort to treat their children equally rather than the parents who deny, deny, deny and end up with a child that KNOWS they come in second, third, fourth etc. place.\n\nGood luck, OP.","Thanks, really, thank you. ","You are correct. I'm a straight male and my best friend and I don't cuddle or kiss each other on the cheek. That's for the gays","The comments in the thread are pathetic. Everyone's advice, for OP to not tell his GF (in other words, to continue lying to her, and therefore to continue being untrue both to himself and to his GF), is based on the ridiculous assumption that honestly has no inherent value and it should only be used as a means to an end. Did OP preface his post by saying his only goal in this scenario is to preserve the relationship? Obviously not. If this was his only goal, he would not even be considering doing this. It appears OP values honesty IN AND OF ITSELF. Why do you think the world is such a horrible, fucked up place? Because everyone is a liar. OP, good for you. By being honest, you take responsibility. By being honest, you treat your SO and yourself with respect. By telling the truth, you are being the truth. There is nothing more important than the truth, nothing. And if people realized that, we wouldn't live in the world that we do. ","I'm in the exact same boat...my husband cheated on me I sought revenge...fell in love...it's been 5 years.

I think the idea of a parent as a source of constant entertainment for their kids is a fairly recent development. It's so much pressure. I'm 48 and and it was a lot different for me and my peers growing up. We were pretty self sufficient as far as finding things to do to entertain ourselves. \n\nI never really felt neglected. And I'm not saying my parents never did stuff with me. It was just different. They were adults and we were kids and they weren't our play buddies, they were our parents. \n\nWho knows if it was better or worse, but I have noticed a lot of people in your situation who struggle with this.

I picked up my badge on the first day during registration, and then you're just required to wear it to get into events for the rest of the time. My boss would come and go as she pleased. By the final day, which was a half-day, after breakfast she told me she was going to go for a swim.

I was an average student in high school, not too far off of where you currently are. Slacked around in high school but wanted to become a civil engineer. When I saw the college curriculum, I thought I'd never make it. I was never \"good\" at math, but I also didn't know that the secret to becoming good was to just do a shitload of problems. I was able to skate through college pre-calc and Calculus I, but I was on the course to failure in Calc II before I realized I needed to just do problems. I passed 4 calculus courses, linear algebra, and Engineering Prob &amp;amp; Stat with a 'B' or higher.

Also told me that he recently went through a really awful divorce (at age 20), and lost custody of his kid.

However, we, as anonymous Internet users, are not the ones who were hurt by your actions; your girlfriend was. So while we can reassure you, or try to alleviate your guilt, ultimately the only way you're going to make things right is by telling her what you've done.\n\nI suggest that you confess this to her, but then tell her that you've already determined ways to show her that you've learned from this, and that this is a mistake you will never repeat again. I've had friends who've cheated from drunken hookups who have sworn off drinking (and still don't drink to this day). I've had friends who've offered to pay for couples' therapy, or go into individual counseling, to see if there are any underlying factors which may've led to their infidelity. You should follow up your apology with an immediate gameplan to prove that this wasn't just a mistake, but an opportunity to grow and mature.\n\nUltimately, however, it's your girlfriend's choice whether or not to continue the relationship, and you MUST respect her wishes either way. If she chooses to leave, do not beg her back into your life. Instead, firmly understand that the consequences of your infidelity are beyond your control, and allow your current guilt to guide you into a positive direction in the future, one in which you don't make the same mistake twice.\n\nI hope this helps.

For me, I believe that the last influences of slavery will be gone when the rates of convictions are more in line with the demographics. For example, 13-17% of citizens in the U.S. identify as black, but factors (such as racial profiling as a result of the failed War on Drugs) have led to a disproportionate number of black Americans (~40% of the U.S. prison population) being arrested and jailed.

Get a grip. If you want to save your marriage you need to get a job. Like yesterday. Get on to some job websites right now and start looking for one. And instead of hooking up with your girlfriend tomorrow, or doing anything else for that matter, look for a damn job. Declare to your wife now that you have the intention of getting a job and saving your marriage because you love her, then keep yourself in your pants and get a job. Any other left over energy you have after looking for work will be spent on your wife and your daughter (preferably in that order). Without a job your wife has lost respect for you. So get that respect back. I know you think you had a good reason to stay home, but this situation is what it is, so it's time to fix it.  \n\nBy the way, if I sound harsh, believe me I'm not trying to be judgmental. I've just been in a very similar position and so I can relate. Mine was a little different because I had a job, but I telecommuted from home. Even though I worked, my partner still resented that I worked from home, to the point that I just rented an office so I would be out of the house. When I got an office to work from, the resentment slowly dissipated and the relationship improved dramatically. If your wife is willing to fix this, it can be done. It's easy in fact, you just need to get out of the damn house.  \n\nAnd by the way, you made a comment about possibly being with the new woman... do you really think it'll be any better? Get out of here! You are both running away from your problems with this affair, and remember - your respective partners are only half of those problems.

Don't be silly man, I'm sure this fling is fun but so are lots of things you shouldn't ruin a marriage for.

The new lady may like you now because you're the nicest port in the storm, but do you think if you go full time she's going to respect that either?  \n\nI'm might buy myself a one-way ticket to down vote city by saying this - but I actually understand why you are having the affair. Humans need affection and I'm sure everything from the attention, to the affection to the sex is awesome (duh!). As much crap as we'll give you, many people in your position would do the same. But listen - you had a child with your wife. You loved your wife so much that you wanted to spend a lifetime with her and literally create a new life together. And now you love that daughter so much that you won't even let anyone else take care of her, so why would you throw away the love that created her in the first place? Getting a babysitter seems a lot more rational then giving your marriage the heave ho. Instead of seeking affection from someone else, how about you win the affection of your wife back?  \n\nYou can do this man, just get moving.","Older women love younger men. It's no secret.

These men did put love and marriage over sex. \n\n&amp;gt;Being sexually unavailable is as bad as being emotionally unavailable. \n\nThat does not give you the right to cheat. \n\n&amp;gt;It's interesting how you conflate monogamy/marriage as well. Are the obligations to each other the same in both scenarios? \n\nI am not sure what you are saying here.

There was some lingering mental issues I needed to deal with, and the only way I could do so was through therapy.\n\nI would suggest going to counseling. Most colleges provide free counseling, so it should be relatively easy to sign up. It might help you explore if you have any underlying issues with sex, or any issues in general. \n\nTrust me, sex is a temporary solution to a permanent problem, and that problem isn't going to go away unless you tackle it head-on. \n\nFeel free to PM me.

I'm in my 30's and never had a desire for joining the military.  I had the luxury of having college paid for so perhaps the military as a choice was less of a consideration although my dad retired from a twenty year military career.  Instead I decided to get a degree in high school math - something I strongly believed in for social progress.  I had many people tip their hat at my endeavors but the prospects for establishing a strong foundation in life soon became less of a reality in the economy that has seemingly failed to develop for us in the past decades along with a few other life choices that were unforeseen.\n\n\nYouth is an interesting era of life and I remember thinking like you are now.  Looking back, I do not regret my decisions but I am now needing to shift my thoughts from giving to society and giving to my family so a career change is well in order.\n\n\nSounds like you have made your commitments to service.  I'd say in your position this will be a great spring board in life for you.  You will be able to parlay your military experience into many better things.  I too have worked with the park service and really enjoyed the folks I was able to work with minus your waterfall excursions.  I'd say stay the course, make more memories for yourself and always look fondly at your time at Yellowstone - no one can take that away from you.  Be care at thinking you should extend a youthful time at the detriment of your future you are clearly working toward.  You're doing well.  The park service will be waiting for you barring any stupid decisions made by the fed gov.  I tip my hat to you young man.

It's messed up, but I've seen it happen numerous times. I've seen hospice patients taken off of hospice, treated for whatever illness or infection to prolong their life, and then once they are better, get put back on hospice so they can get better \"comfort measures\". That is a very draining cycle on everyone. ","Title booboo","Your parents suck at being parents. ","Thank you so much. I am 16. \n\nI am just so worried they will blame themselves. \n\nAnd reliving those moments will be hard.","Seems fair to me. If you can't hold a job then you're either a moron, or have a serious condition that should make you eligible for disability.\n\nSeriously, there's no excuse. Most jobs all you have to do is show up and don't cause fights or drama to keep the job. I worked at Burger King and we had a lady who was extremely \"slow\" to put it nicely. She actually had brain damage from getting abused by her husband or something fucked up. Absolutely no concept of speed, which is typically a pretty important thing in fast food. I drove by the other day and saw her car still there, she still works there after like 4 years. If this lady that quite literally only has half a functioning brain can hold a job, that really doesn't say too much about the people that can't.","If you start valuing yourself you'll find you have much less tolerance for people who don't value you. Plastic surgery won't change you inside, only the work you do in therapy or with self help books or learning about how to develop self esteem will do that. It's a hard road, especially if you're in this loop of negativity. You expect guys to cheat on you, you find guys who are primed towards doing just that, they confirm what you've always erroneously thought about yourself. But if you're willing to put in the work you'll start demanding you receive better treatment because you know you deserve it and you won't get stuck with all these fuckboys who troll for strange. \n\nNow I'm not saying it will never happen again, nobody is cheat proof but at the very least you'll start getting higher quality people in your life and that can't be a bad thing can it? ","Also for your depression, I know they're cliches repeated time and time again by every healthy-living magazine and better-you TV program, but I have to bring these points up because nobody's mentioned them yet. \n\nArtificial light and recycled air aren't doing you any favors. Spend some time in the sun. It's scientifically proven to improve your quality of sleep, make waking up easier, and lift your mood. Sunlight is wonderful for your wellbeing, so find a way to get a bit. However you can enjoy it. Some people like to go hiking, or walk in the park. I'm not an outdoorsy person, so my idea of a \"hike\" is taking the top down on the convertible and going for a nice, long country drive. It's not conventional, but it's good for me and I enjoy it, which means it won't become a chore. \n\nAnd on that note, processed foods probably aren't helping you either. I hate to admit it, but the hipsters were right about eating healthy. Our bodies are (organic) machines, and you have to fuel and maintain them accordingly. As a society, we pump ourselves full of caffeine and sugar and MSG, then wonder why we all feel awful. Cut out all coffee. The excess caffeine isn't helping your long-term focus or productivity, just increasing dependency. Exchange sodas for teas. Limit your alcohol consumption. Switch unhealthy snacks for fresh fruits. You can even upgrade your guilty pleasures; I switched Hershey bars for those all-natural 80% cacao bars, and I feel good about it. \n\nIf you cut all the garbage out of your diet, you won't miss it for very long. I bought a bottle of soda for the first time in a year, and it was so unbearably sweet, I tossed it after a few sips. Now that I haven't had it in a while, it's become so obvious that humans aren't built to consume that shit. \n\nAnd sleep quality is a crucial, overlooked component to happiness. Your brain associates the blue-tinged light from your TV/Phone with daylight, which will prevent you from sleeping quickly and/or deeply, so be conscious of your electronics usage. Being a businesswoman, I assume you're really suceptible to that. \n\nI know, I know. Sunlight, diet, exercise and sleep aren't revolutionary, and they aren't total cures for depression. But I think nowadays it's far too easy to overlook the essentials, and marginalize the crucial role they play.","Is the warmth from a fart or your heated seats in the car.\n\nAnswer: Neither, it is from shit in your pants.","Shit, you want some roommates?","I had the same concern, as I am clumsy af and well-aware of it.

It seems as you may regret that slightly due to the title of the thread? But who knows. I think he could have turned out to be bugging you a lot on media if you would have given him information, but it could also turn out that you would meet him a couple more times and enjoy yourself outside.

But that's the coward's path and I know it. Being close to anyone is scary because being close also makes you vulnerable. If someone choses to love you and bare their flaws and insecurities then you need to respect that. But being close is also what makes relationships wonderful.

","http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man\n\nStraw man fallacies can be made when one is misrepresenting a commonly held view, without an actual debate opponent. Examples from the site:\n\n1) Pro-choicers think all abortions are acceptable (This is almost never the case)\n\n2) If humans descended from monkeys, how come there are still monkeys? (This is attacking a position that was never held by evolutionists).\n\n3) Feminists want women to rule over men. (The rational majority want equal rights, the radicals do not represent the views of the majority). \n\n...And such. You do not need a debate opponent to make a straw man fallacy. It can be done in news articles, journals, etc. (and are frequently called out by opponents, watchdog groups, and readers). You can make a straw man argument in your own thoughts or internal logic as well.\n\nNow for why you were accused for straw man arguments. You made some arguments that were simplified to the point of being mere platitudes. They are intellectual misrepresentations of the argument behind Obama's achievements and failures. Furthermore there was a lack of nuance in any of the views that were mentioned.\n\nEdit: Furthermore if this doesn't convince you, ask yourself if logical fallacies can only be committed in a debate with an opponent.

","Hey, I saw this on r/all. Let me tell you, I neglected my teeth for a long time too. Not as bad as you, I was brushing, but only once a day, and for something like 10 years I didn't go to the dentist and I almost never flossed. My gums bled when I brushed or attempted to floss. It was really unpleasant. Finally one of my teeth broke.\n\nAbout a year ago I decided to do something about it. First I started flossing and brushing twice a day. Within 2 weeks my gums weren't bleeding every time anymore. Then I started going to the dentist. Here in NYC there is the dental college at NYU that you can go to at low cost, so I have been going there. I did have to have a tooth extracted (the broken one), but I was shocked at how little it hurt. They numb you and when pulling it you really only feel pressure. Afterward I was sore, but nothing that some advil and a cup of tea didn't handle. I found out during this process that broken teeth and exposed gums can literally kill you if you don't take care of them. They're major infection risks.\n\nThen I needed a \"deep cleaning\" to get all the accumulated shit off my teeth--even down into the gums. Again, this sounds awful, but with the numbing it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it was. They use a sonic water jet thing to do 90% of the work, and then scrape off the rest--but it didn't really hurt at all. And afterward I was again able to just take advil for 24 hours with no serious problems.\n\nNext I have to get an implant where the tooth was extracted, but I'm no longer worried about the pain aspect of it, just the cost, since that's the most expensive part.\n\nIf you happen to be in the NYC area, PM me and I'll tell you how to get in contact with some people at the NYU dental school if you'd like. Otherwise, I strongly encourage you to tackle it. You're younger than me by more than 10 years, you have a lot of time left to have a social life, and if I can handle it, so can you!","But it's still true that your actions were a reflection of you and not anything that was the victims fault.

I haven't been to the dentist my entire life, because my mother never considered it \"worth the money\". So my dental state has been pretty bad too, and I developed a huge fear of dentists. \n\nOne thing I want to point out that I don't see anyone else bringing up is that poor hygiene can be a really big symptom of depression. I know, because I experience it firsthand. When my depression was at its worst in high school, I pretty much never brushed my teeth (I also didn't shower daily, was generally messy, etc). I know you said you can still enjoy life and don't think about suicide, but you also said you hate your life, and you sound very defeated. You say you don't know why you stopped brushing and said \"maybe laziness\". That's really common with depression, especially blaming yourself for being \"lazy\". Depression can be an awfully sneaky and well disguised beast and a lot of people I know have been diagnosed without previously knowing or realizing that they were really struggling with it.\n\nI really recommend speaking to a therapist. If nothing else, even just to help cope with the fear you're feeling at the mere thought of a dentist. I'm terrified,too. I'll be going for the first time in my life soon, and I would *not* be anywhere close to doing that if I hadn't sought therapy (for my depression and anxiety). It's normal to be afraid, but the fear has gotten to a point where it's severely impacting your life, so it's okay to seek help with that. You may not have the coping skills or mental strength to turn things around on your own, but that doesn't mean there's no hope.\n\nOn a side note, it doesn't sound like you've got much medically wrong with your teeth. Crookedness and gaps generally don't actually need to be fixed, unless they're causing pain or other complications, that's just a weird obsession some countries have with everyone's teeth needing to look exactly the same. The plaque build up, you can start tackling yourself by brushing. A chipped tooth is, again, only a real issue if it's causing complications like pain or infection. I have a chipped front tooth that I've lived with for 15 years now (I'm 25) and it's not a problem, it just looks a bit silly. I think a lot of your fears of needing \"major work\" and being \"too much to fix\" are going to be dispelled with a visit to the dentist. I'll bet he or she will mostly just want to do a good cleaning and then set you up on a strict brushing/flossing/hygiene routine to get you back on track and get your gums healthy. You might have cavities (I know I've finally gotten one) but that's not something they're really going to insist on fixing without warning. All you really need to work up to doing first is just getting an appointment for a new dentist and explain that you're a new patient who hasn't been to a dentist in a long time (it's more common than you might think). And just get looked at. You may even, if you choose to see a therapist, ask them if they know any dentists who work well with  patients with anxiety, so you know the dentist you end up seeing will be patient and not judgmental.\n","[removed]","Stop making up more lies.

To elaborate or too try to at least: a part of my view towards history, in the case of a society, is that of a pendelum. It swings back and forth between either extremes. Does it ever level out and stop? Doesn't seem so yet. Though not through a lack in trying.\n\nIn today's world, little reason for exploring the past is given, while much Is made about condemning the past with no interest in understanding it.\nFuture generations aren't often fond of the excessive abuses of those before them either. Ergo... the rise of contemporary sjw groups to combat racism. \nHowever, regardless of the intentions, the tactics they're employing to fight a monster, is itself, equally monstrous as it is causing the same type and amount of emotional and physical damage that they often  voicefully decry against those they're against ( I. E. Actual racists, but built on the theory for the alleged existence of  white privilege) In the case of the op,  he, or she... is just another casualty of abusive shaming from said groups. Questioning who they are and why they should exist.\nIf that isn't the case, then why are they being made to feel bad for \"something\" they have no part in? The \"Something\" they would likely agree with sjw about otherwise(?) Or then again, perhaps not(?) In either case, it is irrelevant.\n\nSo in historical sense (perhaps, even pervertedly so), to shamelessly  borrow Newton's third law (action-reaction), when too much weight is given to one side with no concern for others, the pendelum loses its momentum and slows to the point that it will begin too swing back to the other side of history with a new alternate being presented too counter the current popular one. It won't be any prettier than what we're dealing with currently either, is my hunch.\n\nWas this of any help to you In explaining my earlier post?\nSorry for the wot.","Next up:  Prunes","[removed]","Yes this, if you're planning to binge eat or are getting the munchies, always practice portion control.

I didn't want them without health insurance because they are not healthy people, and I knew one incident could put them millions of dollars in debt. I decided to pay their health insurance bill, which was $600/month. THAT WAS SO MUCH MONEY FOR ME. I was not paid a lot, but like I said, I was amazing at saving money.

Also, your mom wouldn't be crying because she is disappointed you don't have friends, she is sad because she thinks you are probably sad not having friends.  I think if you talked with them about who you are and how you feel you all would feel better.   At least give them a chance to understand how you tick, you know?  They may not be 100% convinced you don't need a friend, but at least you'll know they know you are ok.  \n\nPlus, it's possible one of your parents is like you.  My husband is super social and I'm not, and our daughter is like my husband and our son is like me.  He is a senior in hs and didn't have friends outside school until this year when a girl liked him and they are now dating.  He still doesn't have dude friends. \n\nYour parents love you so give them a chance to know you better.  You are not a disappointment to them. You sound like a good person and that's what parents are proud of.  If you are happy with your life let them know.  If you aren't happy, seek out places to pursue your interests and you'll find that common ground creates friendships.  But don't feel pressure to have friends, we don't all have the same needs socially and that's ok.  ","It seems many redditors believe that money changing hands alters the idea of consensual sex.

I came into this thread to offer my experience as being the one cheated on in a thoughtful and sensitive way, but this?\n\n&amp;gt;Thank you for your understanding words. I dont think think I'll tell him. We've had our ups and downs, typical couple's squabbles, and sometimes we can really get on each other's nerves, but all in all he's a great guy. He already has a hard time dealing with folks and we both have trouble relating to others, this would surely crush him.\n\n&amp;gt;After a whole year of secrecy there really is no point to springing it on him. I don't plan to do it again. I've had a few opportunities to since then, but now I know what situations to avoid putting myself in to prevent temptation. \n\nNo, fuck you. You don't get to decide that for him. You don't get to decide that keeping it secret is in his best interest. If you had an ounce of respect for him as a person you'd recognize that he's the only one who has a right to decide what he does and doesn't want to know\n\nHe deserves honesty. You already denied him that once by fucking another guy, now you're going to do it again by continuing to lie to him?\n\nUnderstand something, you're lying to your boyfriend, your partner, someone who imagine you say \"I love you\" to, *every single day*\n\nBecause lying by omission is still lying. And it's not just the cheating, you lie to him when you act like you respect him. Because you don't. If you did you wouldn't have fucked a guy he talks to all the time. \n\nYou didn't make a mistake, you made a **choice**. Bumping into a glass of milk is a mistake. You chose to fuck another guy and lie to him about it. \n\nMy ex girlfriend cheated on me for a year, I was madly in love with her. I was planning on proposing to her. And when I found out it *did* crush me. **But I'm eternally thankful that I found out**.\n\nBecause I deserved to know the reality. I'm an adult and I deserve to have all the information available when I decide who I want to spend my life with. Because it's my choice. She didn't lie to me because she feared hurting me, even if she claimed she did, she lied to me because *she* didn't want to lose *me*. Her lying was even more selfish than the actual cheating. \n\nSee this?\n\n&amp;gt;I've had a few opportunities to since then, but now I know what situations to avoid putting myself in to prevent temptation \n\nThis isn't big of you. This isn't an accomplishment. This is the ***bare fucking minimum*** for relationships. Most of us avoid fucking other people every single day of our lives. \n\n&amp;gt;Looking back, I really feel stupid.

He was a scumbag in more ways than one and I let myself get pulled in by good looks and attention. \n\nThis is you trying to skirt responsibility. Trying to portray it as though it's something that just happened *to* you. No, it's something you willingly participated in.\n\nAnd let me explain something as someone whose been here. *He's going to find out*. \n\nNot maybe. He will. Because you didn't just fuck some guy, you fucked a coworker of his. And not only did you fuck his coworker, you fucked his coworker whose a serial cheater and *whose girlfriend knows he is*. You think it's not going to come out to her at some point that he fucked you?\n\nAnd when that happens who do you think the first person she's gonna tell is?\n\nSo here's your two **actual** choices;\n\n- be honest and apologetic and have enough respect for your boyfriend to tell him. Then *he* can decide whether he wants to continue the relationship, whether he wants to try and work through it or end it. Because that's his choice, not yours\n\nOR\n\n- continue lying to him until he finds out from someone else that not only did his beloved girlfriend fuck his coworker, she lied about it and fully intended to continue the relationship without him knowing \n\nI'm sorry if this sounds harsh, I didn't initially plan on being harsh, but as a guy whose been cheated on it outrages me that you're planning to keep it secret. It outrages me because I'm in the unique position to actually have insight as to what *he* might feel.\n\nIt's one thing to do something awful, fess up like an adult, and hope for the best and to be better in the future.

You'll end up feeling that he's wronging you (which isn't necessarily false), that he's being selfish.\n\nThen you'll say well hey in that case why can't you just be a little selfish too? After all you do for him, and you work so hard to keep yourself attractive and in shape, shit you *deserve* to be a little selfish right girl?

It's a normal, natural, healthy human desire, and you're not wrong to feel the lack. Most people who are in relationships want to be, and most people who aren't are unhappy about that. It's not unique to guys, either, there are plenty of women out there that are in the same boat you are. This post could be written by any of millions of awkward loners in the world.\n\nThe other half, though, is that you've idealized and abstracted your 'perfect girl' so much that you're pretty divorced from reality. Relationships are great, but a girl is not going to fix the things you don't like about yourself, or change your life in an instant. Nor is she likely to be the idealized figure you have in your head. To quote Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - one of the best takes I've ever seen on this topic - \"Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind; don't assign me yours.\"\n\nI have the unique experience of having been *both* the lonely nerdy boy *and* the girl such a boy sought after. I've felt both the desperate loneliness and the awkwardness of explaining that no, I'm not here to be your solution to your insecurities. It sucks for everyone involved.\n\nSo at the end of the day, no, you aren't\n\n&amp;gt; in love with the person I'm thinking of\n\nbecause you aren't thinking of a person at all. You're looking for an ideal, an archetype, a concept. No woman is going to be what you have in your head, and *that's a good thing*, because a healthy relationship comes from the understanding and embrace that you and your partner are complex people with your own problems and fears and loves and dreams. And you know this yourself:\n\n&amp;gt; It is embarrassing to admit but I do think I'd fall in love with anyone who would show me compassion, caring, and understanding day after day.\n\nBut look at this from her perspective. How is *she* going to be happier? Are you going to take the same time to invest in her that she takes to invest in you? Take the same interest in her worries as she takes in yours? Be there for her as she is for you? And if you are going to be all of that, does she - a random stranger who doesn't know you yet - have any way of knowing that?\n\n&amp;gt; Sorry to rant, but I don't really have any friends, so I don't have anyone to tell. \n\nIs there even an opportunity for her to get to know you well enough to know any of that? If you want other people to invest in you, to lend you their vulnerability, to lean on you, they need to know that you're invested in them too. No one's going to beat a path to your door to form a relationship with you; you need to go out and build them, even if only one or two people at a time.\n\nThis isn't intended to be an attack on you, by any means. Your feelings are, as I said before, totally normal and natural and understandable. But this is an important part of developing a real relationship that, at least from my read, you seem to lack and need to develop if you want to be that close with anyone, much less a potential spouse. Relationships are not a thing that just happens, and love is not a thing that will find you. You have to work on yourself, and invest in others, before you're going to be the target of someone's love the way you want to be.","Not even his post, he just copied and pasted some other guy's comment -_-","Don't worry about it man, she lied to you.

I'm 28 years old and I'm definitely addicted to orgasms, which I'm only able to have through masturbating. I started consistently masturbating when I was 14.\n\nIt used to be something I did for fun, but I did make the mistake other people have warned you about, I didn't use any kind of lotion or lubrication. I started off using a soft blanket until I was able to do it with just my hand. I've never had a consistent sex life because I mostly date long distance, but I've never had an orgasm that wasn't from either my hand or someone else's hand. I've been close from sex maybe twice, but ultimately couldn't pull it off. It's never bothered my partners, and my fiance and I have no intention of having kids, so I'm okay with the fact that I'll probably never experience an orgasm from any other style.\n\nWhat bothers me about my masturbating is how much it controls my life. It used to be that if I didn't jerk off 14-21 times a week, that it would ruin my sleep. I would wake up way earlier than planned because I would have such intense erections that they would wake me up and wouldn't go away until I masturbated. These days, it doesn't seem to matter if I jerk off 3 times a day, every day, it still wakes me up.\n\nSleep issues aside, if I don't average at least 2 times a day my brain just becomes mush, I get very depressed, and those wake up erections just happen all day long until I can find the chance to act on it. For a few years I had a studio apartment, and my best friend had to move in with me for a while. It reduced how much I could masturbate dramatically, to the point that he ended up having to live half of the week with elsewhere and half the week with me, because I would completely mentally breakdown from not being able to get the amount of release I needed.\n\nI don't think just because you masturbate up to 3 times a day that you're on your way to becoming me. I'm sure there are lots of factors that have led to me becoming the way I am, some of which are unique to me I would imagine. There's some great advice in this thread, so really take it to heart for yourself. Having a girlfriend is something that will likely help you, even for me it helps. When I visit my fiance, I sleep wonderfully even if I'm getting off less than normal. The exhaustion from being sexually active is accurate and helpful on all fronts for me. I get full nights of sleep, I masturbate way less. Even though I don't have an orgasm during sex, that energy that normally is directed into masturbating to get off is just used up in sex itself.\n\nYou're not hopeless, you're probably quite normal. If you really want to cut back, stay out of the areas that you normally masturbate in. Changing your environment can help a lot. For me, going to work helps me on that front. It keeps me focused on other things, and I'm in an area where my body doesn't make the association of being able to masturbate. Sure, there are times where I feel that twinge to go somewhere and masturbate, but it's rare and I can just get over it by taking a quick walk between appointments.","there' nothing wrong with being a sadist as long as your BDSM partner gives consent and you don't permanently harm them","I hope he does.

","[removed]","&amp;gt;The first element of the governing scene I use for this week\u2019s practice comes in a moment of mid-morning spring light. This must have been in 1983 or 1984. I was walking toward the green on Whitehall Street on my way to pick up music I had ordered when I was jolted by my sudden violent reaction to something I had just seen without knowing what it was at first.\n\n&amp;gt;In front of the music store (the shop\u2019s entrance door was two or three steps below street level) I saw a tall laughing youth with long, curly, unkempt golden hair bending with the litheness of a just-discovered height to lay his head on a smiling woman\u2019s shoulder. She was looking up at him with a playful joy. I stood transfixed by an instant, limitless rage at what I had witnessed (American nationalism is made from the refusal to say accurately what it is to be white).\n\n&amp;gt;Of course what had registered before thought had been turned into speech in the mind was that who I was seeing were Judith and Derek. This American fact, and its refusal, of a white woman and her black son\u2014their happiness\u2014outshone the sun. The white possession of the self is untenable.\n\n&amp;gt;The second element of my governing scene for the second historical subject comes from the event in my life of which I am the most ashamed. Two days after the scene I had witnessed in front of the music store I attended a history conference in Lexington, Kentucky. I was delivering a paper on the last day on the invention in the early nineteenth century of an American national historical narrative.\n\n&amp;gt;The night of the first day of the conference I went to a strip club on a side street not far from my hotel. I drank whiskey and fell in love with one of the dancers. Her beauty struck (and seemed to me) beyond anything I had ever known. Her name was Jesse Bishop.\n\n&amp;gt;When I first saw Jesse Bishop, she was naked on a table in front of six white men sitting there around her. (I was at the bar.) The men\u2019s lust transfigured them. I heard crying in the room I couldn\u2019t see. The room seemed filled with it.\n\n&amp;gt;I thought I saw the men feel in her movements the truth of their own desire of which their fear deprived them and for whose sudden public display and knowledge, I thought their smiles and money said, they would never forgive her.\n\n&amp;gt;I thought I saw her answer their money with the abandon of her contempt. She was very young. Her gaze was like an instrument and felt fluent as a touch.\n\n&amp;gt;When the six men left, I paid her to dance for me as long as I could. Although it was against the rules, she allowed me to drive her home.\n\n&amp;gt;While she sat with me between dances, the bartender handed her a corded phone. It was her six-year-old son who couldn\u2019t sleep. His name was Robert. Jesse said Robert was allowed to call her twice a night if he couldn\u2019t sleep but no more than that no matter what. (There was no one Jesse could afford to pay to stay with Robert the hours that she worked.)\n\n&amp;gt;When, near dawn, we reached the driveway of her small home in a new development on the outskirts of Lexington (we had driven in my rented car), I asked if I could come in. I said I wanted to see Robert sleeping. She said she must be crazy, but she let me. There in a narrow child\u2019s bed I saw a child\u2019s untethered breathing\u2014and realized it was a discipline I had never learned and didn\u2019t know how to steal.\n\n&amp;gt;I took my leave of her and went back to my hotel. The next afternoon (the day before my presentation), after many hours of driving, I found her house again, and walked up to her door. I did not have the courage\u2014though I knew I had found my one true love\u2014to knock. There was no bell.\n\n&amp;gt;The second element of my governing scene for the method\u2019s second historical subject is myself watching Jesse dancing on the table in Lexington, Kentucky to the accompaniment of the lust of seven white men.\n\n-George Anderson: Notes for a Love Song in Imperial Time","[deleted]","I never thought about leaving to get surgery, I always thought it would be worse odds if I were to leave.

My parents never took me to the dentist because I was too scared and they were too soft, so my first set of teeth stayed there, rotting in my mouth, blocking the second set to grow straight. \n\nWhen I started to be self conscious about them it was way too late. I never smiled, was chewing my words and was obsessed with other people teeth. I couldn't have a conversation without looking their mouth and thinking that at that distance they could totally see my awful dentition.\n\nI had my first girlfriend ( and even kiss ) at 24 but I was too complexed to be able to enjoy and keep alive that relationship. I met my future wife at age 26 and despite the fact that she didn't seem bothered by my teeth, I still couldn't fill fulfilled. After almost 5 years she pushed me to do something about it.\n\nGot a quote from the dentist, it was expensive, but I felt I would always lack of confidence without getting that done, so we saved some money and invested in an invisalign plan. The first weeks were awful. I could barely talk, my teeth were too soft to bite in a sandwich and I was dreading the time I would have to put or remove my retainers because the pain was so sharp.\n\nAfter a month I got used to it, but the slowness of the process was discouraging. That was just above 5% of the way to good teeth. I kept wearing my retainers every day for a year and half, and almost lost them on a few occasions. Finally I got through the last set of them and got my teeth shaved (this was scary as fuck) and bleached. After 3 years I still wear my retainers at night, but that's a minor price to pay. I can now smile and stop obsessing with what people would think of my teeth.\n\nIt was expensive but was worth every penny, and for the first time of my life I really feel like I can be myself. Not sure what's the best solution for you, braces are more visible, but I see adults using them quite often, there is nothing to be ashamed of.  Invisalign is good too but requires a LOT of self discipline because you need to wear them at least 22 hours a day, and brush your teeth everytime you eat or drink something else than water. The pain can be bad when you change your set of retainers but when you think that's actually because your teeth are moving to the right place, it become almost satisfying.\n\nYou should do something about it bro, it's never too late, but I wished I did it much earlier.","I'm so sorry for your loss.

I'm honestly very curious.\n\nI definitely understand that some white people can be pretty weird / extreme with shit like this, but the implication you made that they are \"protecting you\" from policies and people you don't disagree with is a bit eye-opening. I know it's played up as a temporary immigration ban from countries with supposedly serious terrorism / terrorist harboring issues, but Rudy Giuliani was on Fox News recently (I think today) and basically ratted Trump out as wanting an actual ban on Muslims. He claims Trump consulted him on how to legally bring such a ban about, and Giuliani said he put him in contact with high-powered attorneys that explained to him that, instead of focusing on religion, they should instead focus on \"danger,\" more or less giving such a ban a FACTUAL basis rather than a religious one. \n\nTrump has even openly mused on showing priority to Christian immigrants / refugees, which amounts to discrimination against your religion and others that follow it, so why you don't seem upset with that is beyond me. Several news agencies have been reporting on this; here's a link to the Washington Post if you are interested:\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/29/trump-asked-for-a-muslim-ban-giuliani-says-and-ordered-a-commission-to-do-it-legally/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_giuliani-435pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;amp;utm_term=.552f847ba797\n\nEven conservative outlets are carrying it, if you find more faith in agencies that fall right of center.

You feel afraid that you have to reveal this, because it shows what kind of a person you are.\n\nSeriously, what is it with people here feigning remorse, but not even bothering to actually express it in their posts? ","First, let's deal with this incident and why you've got absolutely nothing to be scared of here. All that's happened is someone's sent you an image, which is almost 100% sure to be, as you said, just some random porn actress. Reverse-Googling that isn't going to get you in any trouble at all. No one will ever know about it, or even care that you did it, as it's totally legal. As another poster said, the people you see on TV getting their houses raided for this are the kind of sickos with hard-drives full of content that they've actively sought out in the shadiest places imaginable. These are the kind of people that are getting in trouble, NOT someone who accidentally sees one image. EVEN IF this image was questionable, you ain't getting in trouble for one image that you closed down immediately (and by the way, which you were sent in the first place by someone who lied about their age).\n\nHonestly, there's really nothing to worry about here, but I get that obsessive thoughts are so fucking hard to beat away. Please don't do anything rash about this, because those obsessive thoughts do not deserve the attention. \n\nMy SO suffers from OCD as a result of her job, and whilst I'll never know myself what the obsessive thoughts are like, I see the pain and anguish it causes people with the condition, and I would not wish it on anybody. She has made some really great progress in the last year however, thought a combination of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and medication.\n\nI won't ask about the details of your OCD, but I'm just wondering if you've been diagnosed formally with it? If not, then that's really the first step to getting some tangible, real help with this thing. I get that you might find it difficult to open up to someone about face-to-face, but the change I see in the person close to me who suffers from the same thing tells me that it's so worth doing.\n\nFrom my personal perspective, OCD is something that develops as a result of your surroundings (i.e. nurture, not nature). There are things that happen in one's life that will almost invite out those intrusive thoughts, that at first you think are just there to protect you, but slowly will control you, scare you and ultimately stop you living your life. Those thoughts will sound like you in your own head, but they're not; think of them as some other thing, some manifestation which is lying to you at every turn. Because that's effectively what those intrusive thoughts are; lies. Every time you give in to those obsessions with compulsive actions, you are feeding them, making them stronger and giving them free reign over your mind. You have the power to say no to them; it's a daunting prospect, but a therapist trained in CBT will absolutely, 100% be able to teach you more about the condition, and how to combat it.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm maybe rambling a bit but I read your post and it really hit home to me, and I want to make sure that you're getting the long-term help with OCD that you need. If you haven't already, go see a doctor and tell them exactly what you feel. If you can get some CBT in the first instance, then that will really help you to deal with the causes of OCD, rather than just the initial symptoms.\n\nStay strong, and don't fret any more about this one incident. You deserve help with this, as no one deserves to live with OCD.","My GF spent 2 years failing college right out of high school.

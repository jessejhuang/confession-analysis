The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.\n\nWhile some 19th-century experiments suggested that the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;amp;message=Excludeme&amp;amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/confession/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","Why were your parents angry?

Let me explain. Maybe not for your benefit, because you are unable to comprehend what you read. But perhaps a third party will find it enlightening.\n\n&amp;gt;I am saying to establish a precedent that it is perfectly okay across the board to allow 15 year olds to begin a transition that completely alters their biological makeup is not the way to go about it. It should be solved with more tact, therapy, and consideration of the future.\n\nWhy would you presume that trans kids are not handled with \"tact, therapy, and consideration for the future?\" Have you read the WPATH guidelines. It doesn't just say \"hand out hormones, money talks.\" It's 71 pages of tact, therapy, and consideration for the future. It's 22 pages of research paper citations. You have no evidence that doctors and therapists don't follow the SoC. \n\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt;75-90% of children evaluated for dysphoria end up not having dysphoria by the time they enter adolescence.\n\n&amp;gt;So if you're saying that 75-90% of people who experience gender dysphoria at 15 end up not having it by the time they enter adolescence\n\nNope! Do you know what an adolescent is? The distinction between a child and an adolescent is important as far as doctors are concerned, especially doctors who treat transgender patients. Adolescence begins at the start of puberty. If you'd known what words mean, you might have avoided the mistake of thinking the 75-90% statistic applies to a 15 year old.\n\n&amp;gt;I'm \"on about\" those who abuse the system or are so misguided in their thinking that they convince themselves and their kids that they are transgender and immediately responding with hormones or surgeries when in reality they're going through a treatable mental health issue.\n\nWho is abusing the system? Where? When? Show some goddamn proof! WPATH recommends a ton of caution. I've never seen a shred of evidence of doctors who violated WPATH guidelines. Not one. But fuckers like you are everywhere on reddit asserting this from nowhere. Surely if a teenager was given surgery, it would be news. If a child was given puberty blockers, it would be news.\n\n&amp;gt;It's fine to be trans, it's fine to be confused, but too many people jump the gun and that's my problem.\n\nWho jumps the gun? Prove it.\n\n&amp;gt;Those who purchase hormones on the internet instead of consulting a doctor maybe? cough cough\n\nMaybe learn to comprehend what you read? I said I looked up how to do it. I didn't say I did it. But, had I been denied by doctors (which I almost guarantee would have been the case at the time) and had I actually successfully bought hormones without a prescription, *I would have been right*. It would have been the right thing to do. I knew then what remains to be true: I am transgender and hormones were/have been an effective treatment for a serious problem. It would have been better to take the risk than allow the cruelty and short-sightedness of society stand in my way.\n\n&amp;gt;You may be right, it might be perfectly fine and we should allow children to make the decision to permanently sterilize themselves and alter their body chemistry whenever they want across the board. But I remain entirely unconvinced and feel it should be treated with far more tact than it is.\n\nAgain, we have a reading problem. When the fuck did I say \"whenever they want across the board?\" I never did. I support the WPATH Standards of Care. Read them. I have. That's why I know what I'm talking about and you don't. You don't actually know how much \"tact\" is used in the treatment of transgender people. You've never been treated for gender dysphoria. You haven't read the guidebook doctors use.

A lot of them are like your average people and don't fuss about silly stuff like someone using the 'wrong pronoun'. \n\nMost of the people who seem to have an actual mental illness are people who aren't transgender but somehow act as if they speak for them.\n\nFrom what I've learned from my psych class when I was in college is that it is a mental illness in a sense where someone feels uncomfortable with being what they were born. I've seen some in-depth documentaries. I'm not talking simple uncomfortable, like for example sometimes I feel like I'd feel more comfortable as a girl, but I don't mind being a boy. I've seen more extreme cases where people are so distraught and so uncomfortable with their gender that it drives them to self-destructive behavior, extreme depression and etc.\n\nA lot of these very extreme cases appear to occur in children at a young age and only get worse and worse as they grow older. These issues lessen or start disappearing outright when they are allowed to openly crossdress (for example at school and use the appropriate bathroom), or even in some very extreme cases get the surgery. A lot of people wouldn't think that trans wanting to use the appropriate bathroom wouldn't be a big deal, but it really is. It breaks the 4th wall in a sense.\n\nThat being said, I tend to address trans people by their preferred pronoun. I don't care whether they got the surgery or not cause more times than not I will see that they are pretty much the gender they want to be as a person, even if not physically.\n\nI draw the line at 'non-binary' though. If you ask me to call you a Ze or whatever the term is, I dunno man. I don't necessarily think there are genders beyond male\\female and maybe neutral. Though I feel like if you feel you are between the two you'd be okay with either pronoun.\n\nI'm not sure whether it's a common trend or not, I just think that as society becomes more open to it, more people feel comfortable enough to be who they want to be.","&amp;gt;Your point is pretty clouded, actually. Go back and read what you wrote. You started out with a couple of *this shouldn't be allowed at all* statements. A subsequent comment you seem to be arguing that doctors don't use any \"tact\" or caution when prescribing hormones, but it's not clear that this applies to teenagers.\n\nNegative. \n\nI am saying to **establish a precedent that it is perfectly okay across the board to allow 15 year olds to begin a transition that completely alters their biological makeup is not the way to go about it. It should be solved with more tact, therapy, and consideration of the future.** A lot of doctors are pressured or simply don't give a shit. Money talks bullshit walks, if your doctor won't do it for you you'll find another who will. \n\nI'm concerned about people jumping the gun and reaching conclusions that may not be based in anything more than emotional distress. You even say it yourself:\n\n&amp;gt;75-90% of children evaluated for dysphoria end up not having dysphoria by the time they enter adolescence.\n\nSo if you're saying that 75-90% of people who experience gender dysphoria at 15 end up **not** having it by the time they enter adolescence is it not crystal clear why merely green lighting transitions for any child who claims to have gender dysphoria is a massive problem? \n\n&amp;gt;\"It should be a **case by case basis**\". Well I have good news: It is! Doctors are cautious. These things take years of evaluation for teenagers. So, what are you on about?\n\nI'm \"on about\" those who abuse the system or are so misguided in their thinking that they convince themselves and their kids that they are transgender and immediately responding with hormones or surgeries when in reality they're going through a treatable mental health issue. It's fine to be trans, it's fine to be confused, but too many people jump the gun and that's my problem. Those who purchase hormones on the internet instead of consulting a doctor maybe? *cough cough*\n\nYou may be right, it might be perfectly fine and we should allow children to make the decision to permanently sterilize themselves and alter their body chemistry whenever they want across the board. But I remain entirely unconvinced and feel it should be treated with far more tact than it is. Think of Ritalin for example, remember all those massive over diagnosis' of ADHD in children and doctors prescribing adderoll to teens basing it on no more than a simple written test given in 10 minutes? (I know from experience) You have far too much faith in our healthcare system. \n\n\n&amp;gt;YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND GENDER DYSPHORIA! IT IS NOT THE SAME AS THOSE OTHER THINGS!\n\nBut I have a mental flipping illness, and if I could get rid of my BPD by chopping off my cock I still wouldn't flippin do it especially at 15 unless I found through a reasonable examination of my options and risks involved a positive benefit I can get from it. Unfortunately, there are MANY risks to transitioning. \n\n&amp;gt;No, it's not an ad hominem or an \"ad homonym.\" Ad hominem is an attack on the person arguing instead of the argument itself. Trying to discredit you, attacking your lack of qualifications, or questioning your motivation or prejudices is an ad hominem. An ad homonym is a slang misspelling of ad hominem meant to point out people who attack spelling/grammar errors rather than the argument. What I did was use you as an example in my argument and you didn't like it. I don't really give a shit if you didn't like it. The point is that denying someone medical treatment is cruel, and anyone who would inflict that cruelty on a 15 year old deserve cruelty.\n\nYou're literally insane.

Every little thing - every nuisance, every problem - is the end of the world to them. No juice in the sippy cup? Throw a tantrum. Hungry? Throw a tantrum.\n\nBut to toddlers - in their mind, at least - these are valid concerns, and how they react are valid reactions. To an adult, it's a bit dramatic. To *me*, it's dramatic. But to the toddler, it's not, and that's because their brain hasn't really developed to the point that these things are dramatic, yet.\n\nYou're in middle school, so you're... 12? 13? A **lot** of shit happens in your brain during that age, and some brains change faster than others. What you see as dramatic or abnormal may not be what your friend sees as dramatic or abnormal - but it by no means negates her cry for help. She's reaching out in the only language that she knows *now* - in a year or two, she might reach out differently, but she's still reaching out all the same. You reacting the way that you did? That's also because your brain is changing. To put it blunt, people at your age struggle with empathy - and that's because the part of your brain responsible for being able to feel empathy isn't fully developed, yet. I mean, how you reacted was obviously not a good way to react, but don't beat yourself up too much over it - you'll learn. You're not a bad person; you're young, and the fact that you feel bad for the way that you reacted pretty much implies that you're not a bad person. You just made a shitty mistake. We all did when we were your age. Lord knows I've done worse.\n\nLet her know that you're sorry. Tell her that you didn't know how to react, and understand that it may take a while for her to trust you, again - but that's okay. Demonstrate to her, in action, that you care about her. I don't know if the two of you are still talking, but if she doesn't want to talk to you, respect that - give her some distance. But I really think it's worth letting her know that you're sorry, and that you care. You just didn't know how to respond, is all. A cry for attention is still a cry for help; tell her that you didn't see it for what it was at first, and only saw what was on the surface and judged too soon, and far too harshly. It doesn't matter if she was crying for attention - she was crying for attention for a reason, and a pretty valid one at that. THAT'S what matters.\n\nOkay, so as for the cutting, itself? That's tough. I've known two people that used to cut - one when I was your age, and another just a few years ago, when I was ~21 years old. Please, please, *please* keep in mind that it's a really, really sensitive issue - it's not a matter of whether you're a good enough friend or not that determines whether she cuts or doesn't cut. There are no \"magic words\" to get her to stop. Trust me, you'll feel like there *must* be, but there aren't. What you need to do, more than anything, is to be patient with her - within reason, anyway. Cutting is obviously dangerous, and it is *clearly* a cause for concern, but short of physically restraining her or keeping her supervised 24/7, she's going to do what she feels like doing.\n\nMore than anything, try not to treat her differently - let her know that, yeah, you're concerned, but please keep in mind that you're her friend, first and foremost, and what she needs right now, more than anything, is the stability that friendship provides. I mean, yeah, let her know that you're here for her and that you're worried, and that you care, but if you focus too much on being a caregiver to her, that *will* change the very dynamic of your friendship with her, and most likely not in a good way - you won't be her friend, anymore; you'll be her therapist. There's a reason why therapists and psychologists exist, and why it's generally a better idea to see a psychologist or a therapist instead of relying entirely on a friend - they literally went to school to figure out what to say and how to help. It's so easy to say the wrong thing, or to accidentally make things worse. That's why she needs to see a therapist, if she can. They're generally trained *not* to say the wrong things.\n\nThere will be times where your friend doesn't want to talk, or where you'll have a really difficult time getting her out of her shell - but be patient. Don't force anything. Be her friend. And please, don't stop having fun with her - she needs the balance of talking about her problems to a therapist and having fun with her friends. If she teeters too much one way, she could end up dwelling too much on her issues, which is a recipe for disaster - but if the balance teeters the other way, she'll keep cutting; nothing will change, and none of her problems will be addressed. She NEEDS a balance.\n\nSorry for the long-winded reply. I just don't want you to make the mistakes that so many others make, because this is a pretty sensitive issue that's easy to accidentally make worse. Best of luck.","Ahh New Year's Eve baby!

It\u2019s important to remember that some people are good at their jobs, and some people are not. This is true of mental health workers as much as any other line of work. I hope this experience doesn\u2019t dissuade you from getting help. To get the most benefit out of therapy, you have to make a natural connection with the therapist, so you may have to talk to a couple. I had sessions that were ultimately not helpful with two therapists, before finding success with a third, years later. That said, no mental health worker can simply fix you. It\u2019s not like physical problems, like setting a broken arm or stitching up a wound. You have to put in a lot of effort to get better, but it will be worth it. That said, depression can never be cured, only mitigated. Once you work through the issues that got you where you are now, you will have to employ strategies like physical activity, socialization, self care, and possibly medication to maintain your mental health. Finally, I noticed a few suggestions that you go see that first psychologist and tell them how your experience was all their fault. I think that\u2019s a bad idea, it\u2019s spiteful and unhealthy.

I myself went through a period of time when I was 17 or so where I started finding myself questioning my belief in God. Up until around this time we were always a pretty traditional Christian family. My mom was the most extreme of us all and spent all her life dealing with a lot of religious guilt and conviction, both self-inflicted and otherwise. My dad joined the scene a bit later, got saved at one of those big outdoor travelling conferences, and he jumped into the scene with a fervor.  \nI was lucky that my parents started to ease up and relax a little at the same time I started having my doubts, because it helped them be supportive of me. As I started to unwrap my feelings, I came to the realization that it wasn't God's existence I was doubting, but rather the church's, and people's, sincerity. From that revelation other truths started to become apparent to me: The posturing and pandering, the favoritism and popularity games...my problem wasn't with God. My problem was with people. Up until that point I had had the misfortune of being surrounded by some incredibly poor representations of the Christian faith, people hiding behind a facade of godliness while pushing their agendas, even at the expense of others' well being.  \nFrom the moment I removed myself from the public aspects of Christianity and made my faith a private one, I felt a peace come over me, and my relationship with God has only deepened since then. My parents came to the same point as well, and so now I can openly and freely talk with both of them about how we feel. For pretty much everyone else, I take on a \"none of your damn business\" attitude.  \nThis may or may not be the case for you. Each of us walks our own path, and we come to our own destinations. I've since met lots of people, both Christian and otherwise, who are wonderful people with strong morals and good ethics. If you feel like this might be the case for you as well, I would suggest removing yourself from the church establishment for a while. Seek some peace and quiet away from all the noise and hustle and bustle, and see what you can hear when the distractions are no longer drowning everything out.","I would totally date a man who did drag and fan girl over all his outfits.

Dreams are a way for your mind to organize and categorize your thoughts. Your dream most likely was not you truly wanting to be with him, it was merely a thought that was being filed away in your mind. I understand where you are coming from...

We fantasize, daydream and think about the situations that would arise and how they might be better than where we are now. That is human nature.\n\nLet's call it... The adult form of the imagination. Instead of daydreaming about dragons or space travel, we constantly think about where we would be if we weren't here. This can get dangerous if not put into check, but like I said before it is completely natural. My advice is to take a step back from those memories, thoughts and feelings for a few days and focus directly on where you are now with no tabs on your old friend. Love where you are and remember why you fell for your husband. Hell... If you get desperate and start thinking sexually, grab your husband or go somewhere and take care of yourself before acting anywhere else. Sometimes getting rid of that sexual tension on your own will do wonders for your clarity of thought. \n\nDefinitely keep us updated on how you do and reach out for help.

I'm the guy you hate, I've been honked at more than I can count, I've been ridden off the road, yelled at, literally anything you've thought of doing or saying to a cyclist (other than killing them I guess) it's happened to me a number of times. \n\nFirst off, there's no greater desire as a cyclist to be away from cars. I hate being an annoyance, (unrealistic or not) it's dangerous and it kills the ride. I will find every opportunity to ride on a road with no cars, or a big shoulder but that's just unrealistic because roads = cars. Especially the ones that get you anywhere. It's the strangest thing though... Anytime a car honks at me and my friends, we've been on an isolated road for 10-20 minutes by ourselves, enjoying the scenery, the peace and quiet, sharing stories and laughing, we're as far over as we can get... then a car comes blazing by, honking swerving at us, and is gone in a matter of 3 seconds.. Back to 10-20 minutes of silence. It's the strangest phenomenon because you can't help but think \"why\".. It's so unavoidable... Literally so much stress, risk and rage for 3 seconds of inconvenience. (debatable if it's even inconvenient, most of the time it's a passable scenario) It's just a god damn drive. I know it adds up over time but by how much? I think this part here is where the cyclist entitlement comes from some people, when you see this so much its hard to not fight back a little. \n\nI promise about 95% of cyclists completely would agree with all the hate here, and also that they don't want to be sharing the road with cars either but cycling is a ton of fun and it's not worth giving up, even if it means being annoying to someone for 3 seconds of their life. Everyone should give cycling a try sometime. \n\nRiding on a sidewalk is such a lame solution, why would anyone even suggest that, you end up pissing off  everyone and all the driveways and side streets makes it so dangerous. \n\nRed light running is such complicated issue too, you got the thrill seeker types who are 0.05% of the population ruining it for all of us.. and then bikers who \"jaywalk\" safely when the lights don't pick you up. I'm not going to sit there for 10 minutes, no one will. \n\nSolution - Bike lanes.. Everytime. I've never got honked at for being in a bike lane, literally no one hates cyclists when they are not in your way. So it's not really the cyclist you hate, it's the roads. \n\nAnd lastly, maybe some understanding from both sides. I'm sure we could all grab a beer and have a good time together.

Sometimes I get stuck in the mirror thinking about dying, aging, and the pointlessness of everything, and it's really tough. Being stoned is definitely a nice break from this kind of stress, and I think it's okay to indulge in it as long as you're still feeling functional and healthy. \n\nHere's some stuff that helps me deal with my constant existential crisis, maybe it'll help you too:\n\n\n1) it's important to have a hobby you really like, that you can look forward to. Passion and creation can make life worth living simply because they're invigorating to experience, and can give you a sense of usefulness and meaning. Personally, I read, write, and play Dungeons and Dragons. \n\n2) Get into charity: Helping others less fortunate than yourself can really start to make you appreciate your privileges more, and relieving suffering in others can give you a purpose and help make your life meaningful. Even if we are just the products of evolution, we evolved to live in a society, to be capable o both suffering and compassion. Even if you think your actions don't have meaning in a cosmic sense, they will have a world of meaning for the person you're helping. If you don't like people, you can volunteer at an animal shelter. If you're super busy, try doing one unnecessary nice thing for someone else once a day, or even once a week. \n\n3) Experience art that deals with the existential questions you've been struggling with. Some of it may have answers for you, and even if it doesn't, it's always nice to know that you're not alone. Some of my top recommendations for media that deal with questions of purpose/meaning/existential crisis.\n\nBooks: anything by Kurt Vonnegut (but especially Breakfast of Champions and Sirens of Titan), Invisible Man- Ralph Ellison, The Catcher in the Rye- J.D. Salinger, The Bell Jar- Sylvia Plath, The Stranger-Camus, Don Quixote- Cervantes, The Unbearable Lightness of Being- Mila Kundera, Fight Club- Chuck Palahniuk, Infinite Jest- David Foster Wallace, and tbh Harry Potter books 5-7. \n\nMovies/Plays: Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Waiting for Godot, Hamlet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (but see/read Hamlet first), No Exit, Fight Club, Synecdoche New York, Groundhog Day, Birdman, Mr. Nobody\n\nStraight Up, Dry Philosophers you could check out: Satre, Kierkegaard, Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, and, of course, Nietszche himself \n\nAlso, horror and anime/animation tend to deal with Existentialism a lot, but not everybody likes those genres (I'm a big fan), but if you like those I can give you some more recommendations if you want.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the huge post. I think about this stuff a lot too. I think what's most important for you to keep in mind that the struggle for meaning and the knowledge of our own eventual Death is part of the human experience, that most people will struggle with whether they want to or not.

The problem was many times these expectations where created by me, and the \"repercussion\" were not nearly as bad as I thought.

Obviously the child was weak because they couldn\u2019t handle being consistently bullied by someone else. This is a child, not an adult. They do not act rationally. Expecting a child to behave as a negotiator/politician is ridiculous and naive. To think that bullies would have responded to be told \u201cyou are hurting my feelings\u201d is equally naive and stupid. Parents and teachers were involved and there was still no change in behavior. A catalyst must occur to reach that change. If the child is never bullied again from their one response, was it not successful and worth it? If the bully never bullies again, was it worth it?That sounds like perfect conflict resolution. \n\n2. His lesson was not punching his way to resolution. He saw his father try other means first. The child should realize that it is a last resort, but a resort non-the-less.

The vast majority of gun deaths are suicides, or domestic assaults, accidental shootings, etc.  The cause of most of this nation's gun problems are a result of *so many people just have an unsecured gun in their home*.\n\nIf you think about it, if people did not have guns in their homes, they would not have *the opportunity* to use a gun in any of these bad ways.  Australia recognized this, and outlawed certain types of guns, and conducted massive buy-backs, which had the effect *of removing guns from people's homes*. And Australia saw a corresponding decline in gun deaths as a result.\n\nThe same would be true in America - it's a fact that less guns would equal less gun deaths.  It is what it is regardless of which 'side' of this debate you're on.  So, this is the guiding principle I keep in mind any time people bring up this gun debate - is what is being 'saved' or 'taken away' something that would be pretty beneficial to actually saving lives?\n\nThe other thing I like to think about is that - as you know - guns are a hobby for many people, whether hunting or just shooting.  People enjoy it, and I believe people should be allowed to do it.  But another principle I have is thinking about what constitutes safe and necessary equipment for people to enjoy that hobby.  Are silencers, huge magazines, bump stocks, etc - really necessary for people to conduct this as a hobby?  I don't think so, but people can disagree on that - but it seems reasonable that we could put limits on what people should be able to have as equipment, because like in Vegas, a guy with a bump stock could be using his rifle like an automatic rifle - and there's a reason we outlawed selling automatic rifles after the 80's.\n\nAnother guiding principle is thinking about whether people just carrying guns around increases overall public safety.  Mass shootings are extremely rare, as are other circumstances where people owning handguns and carrying them around would be effective.  This has to be considered against the 'cost' of having millions of handguns just sitting around people's homes, which, as I said, leads to a situation in which a lot of people use those guns to commit suicides and domestic violence, for instance.\n\nI'm not trying to give you an answer here - but I would just encourage you to think about this for yourself, and in a common sense way.  Don't let people on either side of the issue - read about both sides yourself, if you're interested in it, and understand the facts, because there's no crystal clear solution to this - it's an argument about what true rights people have in this society vs. the cost to this society from fully expressing those rights.\n\n","The problem here is there's a different culture. That's why there's comments that say it won't work here. Additionally even if it wasn't a cultural problem, it'd have to be a federal movement to prevent people from just skipping over state lines and getting a gun, and right now gun laws are mainly a states right issue\n\nIt could work in time, but the chances of the culture changing and the federal government taking the issue away from the states are low enough for most people to just say it won't work.","She lives with them","[deleted]","No it does not make you a worse mother.

I have seen, heard of, and worked with people with BPD who have held career jobs. I'm going to be honest here though, I've also helped people with BPD get on disability benefits because I did not believe they had the capacity to hold employment. Those individuals were in their late 40's and 50's however, so I think age and history had a big part of those decisions. Getting you to work will be a big hurdle, but it'll also be something I think you can accomplish. A huge component of BPD is the depressive and anxiety symptoms, existential anxiety paired with a depressive numbness is going to make work really challenging for your brain to think of in a positive-light. Unfortunately, our society isn't the best at providing support to people in your position. I can't give much advice through this sort of message, but don't be afraid of volunteering your time, joining Peace Corp., or finding work with less pay but more meaning making, even if only for a short time. \n\nAs far as finding a therapist that cares... that can be really hard. Plenty of therapist care, but they also view their work as employment and BPD may at times need more than an hour per week. Others care, but they aren't experienced or knowledgeable enough about BPD to adapt to your specific needs in treatment. The person has to tolerate your intensity when it occurs and be comfortable with your missed appointments on the days where you can't make it. My advice is call perspective therapist before your first appointment. Let them know about your diagnosis and ask how they go about treatment. Talk them about the number of voice-mails they are capable listening to per week, whether or not you can have flexible schedules and how they address anger, anxiety, panic, etc. in their work. I know many of the people I've treated have felt as though they were constantly being judged, declined, rejected, abandoned...  even by their therapist. I would say during that first conversation you need to ask the person how comfortable they are sharing their experience with you in the moment. I've been accused of not caring plenty of times, but for me in particular, they often felt as though I was overwhelmed (I tend to pull for people to try to take care of me). Usually though, they weren't accurate and I was comfortable talking about what was going on for me behind the scenes so to speak. If the person is CBT/DBT/ACT or the other behavioral treatment styles, they might be a bit more rigid in their treatment with you... which is helpful in a way. If the person is more client-centered you may feel they aren't being helpful even if you are connected well during sessions. If the person leans towards the more psychodynamic approaches (asks about your childhood history, parents, early memories, etc) they may be helpful, but it'll be slow and is not well supported as a treatment for BPD. So... what do you look for as a treatment style? I would advise someone who understands these styles, but is flexible in their approach and willing to integrate when needed. \n\nPlease don't give up. There is a therapist out there who can help. It's important that you know what will work for you and what hasn't, I would be really up-front with those before you even sit down for a session. Make a ranked list of which therapist seem strong in which areas, then try them out. The right therapeutic relationship is going to do wonders to help you stay on your feet.

You're talking like a passive participant. You're saying it wasn't something that you could have controlled, but something that just evolved or happened on its own. This sentence betrays a disastrous character flaw and mindset.

I would invite them over and they'd show up and we would have fun doing whatever we did. Nearly my entire life I desired to have someone who found me just as special as I found all my friends to be. But it would seem that no one would ever invite me anywhere or they would never call. Eventually I got fed up and set out to prove whether my friends were my actual friends or if they were just to cowardly to tell me to go fuck myself. I stopped calling all my friends. If they called me I'd answer and be excited to hear from them. No one, not one of those guys called. I never saw my \"friends\" again.\nSince then I've made one friend who calls or texts me every now and then. He lives three states away from me and has a small family. My brother calls me and I text memes to my cousins. As far as friends go that is all I have. Brother, two cousins and a friend. That counts as four people who I can count on. People I don't have to call in order to keep in contact. I contact all of them as often as I can.\nOp, I'd recommend that you stop calling your friends and find out who truly cares for you. Once you do, shower them with love and respect and you will have fantastic reliable lifelong friendships. It just might be one or two or, hopefully, all of them and they're just distracted at the moment. ","You're young - just apologize and ask her forgiveness.

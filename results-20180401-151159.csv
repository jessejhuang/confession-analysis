"And if they don't have a family or a really shitty one? How about they just don't want to be depressed with the constant reminders that they're dying and want to get immersed in something other than their own mortality for a change?

"I had a positive relationship with her but I wouldn't say we're emotional close. She loves me and I love her and I love spending every minute with her but it wasn't the bonding type. I don't think I ever felt that way about any of my relatives. Her death was expected since she's been on the tubes for a couple months. I just felt ashamed cuz I look around and I could see everyone so upset but me. I do share your relieve of letting someone go when they're in pain. I did cry when I saw my grandma with those tubes forced down her throat. ",,1512545912,0,dqucs7c,,2.4094422393949877E-4

"Yep you’re right lol. I’m not friends with them anymore. My buddy asked if he could bring them up to my place and I stupidly said yes. Should’ve thought that one through but I was just trying to be polite. I was never really friends with them, they were just the type of people where I would hang out with them only if someone else invites them so more of acquaintances.",,1512495164,0,dqt4s8g,,3.083123382656705E-4

"You are not a wreck! You are still here! And after your ordeal that is a massive accomplishment!

Do you have good friends around you? 
They won’t understand what you have been through, and may not know how to act around you, even now. But it’s up to you wether you want to talk about it, or not. 

This is still affecting you, understandably. Also PTSD is not uncommon after what you have been through?
It really helps to have a good support network around you. Friends, family, your SO. Or even better a councillor. Even if it’s only one person you can bear to talk to.

The fact that you have written this post is really brave. And I think sometimes it’s easier to share with strangers than the people closest to you.

I’m sorry I can’t offer any real advice but I’m here if you want to PM xx

"I know my sister didn't do anything wrong. It's why I'm struggling with myself and feel so guilty. Logically, I know all these things, but I can't just say ""that doesn't make sense. I'm not going to feel that anymore"". I've tried, honestly, and it doesn't work. My father is to blame, yes, and so is my mother, in some places, but my mother wouldn't have found some other craziness. She made some really bad choices because we were in desperate circumstances. I've resented her for a long time and will still be unable to make peace with a lot of things she's done, but I know that my mother honestly tried to do the best for all of us, though she did place my sister way above my brother and I. She wanted to keep my brother (who was two/three at the time) and me away for the first eight months of my life because they thought my sister had Ebola, and as babies especially, my mother only had to come in contact with my sister to risk infecting my brother and I. Also, my brother and I were staying with my father who wouldn't take off work to take us to the state my mother and sister were in for a visit, and my mother coming to visit us would mean leaving my sister alone in the hospital at the age of five for a weekend. I understand her explanation, but it still hurts to know I didn't recognise my mother when I first saw her, and wouldn't go near her for a long time because she was a stranger to me. Thank you for explaining that I'm still a virgin, though. That's actually really comforting to me.",,1512244983,0,dqo4306,,4.313260888750836E-4

"I feel like just the deed alone wouldn't be enough. If a branch fell to the ground and no one was there to hear it, did it make a sound? He needs to know too, you know but not too obvious in which I tell him directly but instead I would write him anonymously and making him guess which one of his previous roommates did it.

I guess I'm just that vindictive but only if he really, really deserves it.",,1512328632,0,dqpnwe7,,4.966429595454347E-4
